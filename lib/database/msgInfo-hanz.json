Joko Widodo atau Jokowi (lahir di Surakarta, Jawa Tengah, 21 Juni 1961; umur 59 tahun) adalah Presiden ke-7 Indonesia yang mulai menjabat sejak 20 Oktober 2014. Terpilih dalam Pemilu Presiden 2014, Jokowi menjadi Presiden Indonesia pertama sepanjang sejarah yang bukan berasal dari latar belakang elite politik atau militer Indonesia. Ia terpilih bersama Wakil Presiden Muhammad Jusuf Kalla dan kembali terpilih bersama Wakil Presiden Ma'ruf Amin dalam Pemilu Presiden 2019. Jokowi pernah menjabat Gubernur DKI Jakarta sejak 15 Oktober 2012 hingga 16 Oktober 2014 didampingi Basuki Tjahaja Purnama sebagai wakil gubernur. Sebelumnya, ia adalah Wali Kota Surakarta (Solo), sejak 28 Juli 2005 hingga 1 Oktober 2012 didampingi F.X. Hadi Rudyatmo sebagai wakil wali kota.[5] Dua tahun menjalani periode keduanya menjadi Wali Kota Solo, Jokowi ditunjuk oleh partainya, Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan (PDI-P), untuk bertarung dalam pemilihan Gubernur DKI Jakarta berpasangan dengan Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok).[6]\nJoko Widodo berasal dari keluarga sederhana, bahkan rumahnya pernah digusur sebanyak tiga kali ketika dia masih kecil,[7] tetapi ia mampu menyelesaikan pendidikannya di Fakultas Kehutanan Universitas Gajah Mada. Setelah lulus, dia menekuni profesinya sebagai pengusaha mebel.[7] Karier politiknya dimulai dengan menjadi Wali Kota Surakarta pada tahun 2005.[8] Namanya mulai dikenal setelah dianggap berhasil mengubah wajah Kota Surakarta menjadi kota pariwisata, kota budaya, dan kota batik.[9] Pada tanggal 20 September 2012, Jokowi berhasil memenangi Pilkada Jakarta 2012. Kemenangannya dianggap mencerminkan dukungan populer untuk seorang pemimpin yang \"muda\" dan \"bersih\", meskipun umurnya sudah lebih dari lima puluh tahun.[10]\nSemenjak terpilih sebagai gubernur, popularitasnya terus melambung dan menjadi sorotan media.[11][12] Akibatnya, muncul wacana untuk menjadikannya calon presiden untuk pemilihan umum presiden Indonesia 2014.[13] Ditambah lagi, hasil survei menunjukkan, nama Jokowi terus unggul.[14] Pada awalnya, Ketua Umum PDI-P, Megawati Soekarnoputri menyatakan bahwa ia tidak akan mengumumkan calon presiden dari PDI Perjuangan sampai setelah pemilihan umum legislatif 9 April 2014.[15] Namun, pada tanggal 14 Maret 2014, Jokowi menerima mandat dari Megawati untuk maju sebagai calon presiden, tiga minggu sebelum pemilihan umum legislatif dan dua hari sebelum kampanye.[16]\nJoko Widodo lahir dari pasangan Widjiatno Notomihardjo dan Sudjiatmi. Ia merupakan anak sulung dan putra satu-satunya dari empat bersaudara. Ia memiliki tiga orang adik perempuan bernama Iit Sriyantini, Ida Yati, dan Titik Relawati.[17] Ia sebenarnya memiliki seorang adik laki-laki bernama Joko Lukito, tetapi meninggal saat persalinan. Sebelum berganti nama, Joko Widodo memiliki nama kecil Mulyono.[18] Ayahnya berasal dari Karanganyar, sementara kakek dan neneknya berasal dari sebuah desa di Boyolali.[19] Pendidikannya diawali dengan masuk SD Negeri 112 Tirtoyoso yang dikenal sebagai sekolah untuk kalangan menengah ke bawah.[20]\nDengan kesulitan hidup yang dialami, ia terpaksa berdagang, mengojek payung, dan jadi kuli panggul untuk mencari sendiri keperluan sekolah dan uang jajan sehari-hari. Saat anak-anak lain ke sekolah dengan sepeda, ia memilih untuk tetap berjalan kaki. Mewarisi keahlian bertukang kayu dari ayahnya, ia mulai bekerja sebagai penggergaji di umur 12 tahun[7][21]. Jokowi kecil telah mengalami penggusuran rumah sebanyak tiga kali. Penggusuran yang dialaminya sebanyak tiga kali pada masa kecil mempengaruhi cara berpikirnya dan kepemimpinannya kelak setelah menjadi Wali Kota Surakarta saat harus menertibkan permukiman warga.[22]\nSetelah lulus SD, ia kemudian melanjutkan pendidikan di SMP Negeri 1 Surakarta.[23] Ketika ia lulus SMP, ia sempat ingin masuk ke SMA Negeri 1 Surakarta, namun gagal sehingga pada akhirnya ia masuk ke SMA Negeri 6 Surakarta.[24]\nJokowi menikah dengan Iriana di Solo, tanggal 24 Desember 1986, dan memiliki 3 orang anak, yaitu Gibran Rakabuming Raka (1988), Kahiyang Ayu (1991), dan Kaesang Pangarep (1995).\nDengan kemampuan akademis yang dimiliki, ia diterima di Jurusan Kehutanan, Fakultas Kehutanan Universitas Gajah Mada. Kesempatan ini dimanfaatkannya untuk belajar struktur kayu, pemanfaatan, dan teknologinya. Ia berhasil menyelesaikan pendidikannya dengan judul skripsi \"Studi tentang Pola Konsumsi Kayu Lapis pada Pemakaian Akhir di Kodya Surakarta\". Selain kuliah, ia juga tercatat aktif sebagai anggota Mapala Silvagama.\nSetelah lulus pada 1985, ia bekerja di BUMN PT Kertas Kraft Aceh, dan ditempatkan di area Hutan Pinus Merkusii di Dataran Tinggi Gayo, Aceh Tengah. Namun ia merasa tidak betah dan pulang menyusul istrinya yang sedang hamil tujuh bulan. Ia bertekad berbisnis di bidang kayu dan bekerja di usaha milik pamannya, Miyono, di bawah bendera CV Roda Jati. Pada tahun 1988, ia memberanikan diri membuka usaha sendiri dengan nama CV Rakabu, yang diambil dari nama anak pertamanya. Usahanya sempat berjaya dan juga naik turun karena tertipu pesanan yang akhirnya tidak dibayar. Namun pada tahun 1990 ia bangkit kembali dengan pinjaman modal Rp30 juta dari Ibunya.[25]\nUsaha ini membawanya bertemu Micl Romaknan, yang akhirnya memberinya panggilan yang populer hingga kini, \"Jokowi\". Dengan kejujuran dan kerja kerasnya, ia mendapat kepercayaan dan bisa berkeliling Eropa yang membuka matanya. Pengaturan kota yang baik di Eropa menjadi inspirasinya untuk diterapkan di Solo dan menginspirasinya untuk memasuki dunia politik. Ia ingin menerapkan kepemimpinan manusiawi dan mewujudkan kota yang bersahabat untuk penghuninya yaitu daerah Surakarta.[21]\nPada pilkada kota Solo pada tahun 2005, Jokowi diusung oleh Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan (PDI-P) dan Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa (PKB) untuk maju sebagai calon wali kota Surakarta. Ia berhasil memenangkan pemilihan tersebut dengan persentase suara sebesar 36,62%.[8] Setelah terpilih, dengan berbagai pengalaman pada masa muda, ia mengembangkan Solo yang sebelumnya buruk penataannya dan menghadapi berbagai penolakan masyarakat untuk ditertibkan. Di bawah kepemimpinannya, Solo mengalami perubahan dan menjadi kajian di universitas dalam dan luar negeri.[9] Salah satunya adalah kemampuan komunikasi politik Jokowi yang berbeda dengan kebanyakan gaya komunikasi politik pemimpin lain pada masa itu, yang menjadi kajian riset mahasiswa pascasarjana Universitas Indonesia.[26]\nDi bawah kepemimpinannya, bus Batik Solo Trans diperkenalkan,[27] berbagai kawasan seperti Jalan Slamet Riyadi dan Ngarsopuro diremajakan,[28] dan Solo menjadi tuan rumah berbagai acara internasional.[28] Selain itu, Jokowi juga dikenal akan pendekatannya dalam merelokasi pedagang kaki lima yang \"memanusiakan manusia\".[29] Berkat pencapaiannya ini, pada tahun 2010, ia terpilih lagi sebagai Wali Kota Surakarta dengan suara melebihi 90%.[30] Kemudian, pada tahun 2012, ia dicalonkan oleh PDI-P sebagai calon Gubernur DKI Jakarta.[6]\nJokowi diminta secara pribadi oleh Jusuf Kalla untuk mencalonkan diri sebagai Gubernur DKI Jakarta pada Pilgub DKI tahun 2012.[31] Karena merupakan kader PDI Perjuangan, maka Jusuf Kalla meminta dukungan dari Megawati Soekarnoputri, yang awalnya terlihat masih ragu. Sementara itu, Prabowo Subianto dari Partai Gerindra juga melobi PDI Perjuangan agar bersedia mendukung Jokowi sebagai calon gubernur karena membutuhkan 9 kursi lagi untuk bisa mengajukan calon gubernur.[32] Sebagai wakilnya, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama yang saat itu menjadi anggota DPR dicalonkan mendampingi Jokowi.[33] Pasangan ini awalnya tidak diunggulkan. Hal ini terlihat dari klaim calon pertama yang diperkuat oleh Lingkaran Survei Indonesia bahwa pasangan Fauzi Bowo dan Nachrowi Ramli akan memenangkan pilkada dalam 1 putaran.[34] Namun hasil pilgub putaran pertama dari KPU memperlihatkan Jokowi memimpin dengan 42,6% suara, sementara Fauzi Bowo di posisi kedua dengan 34,05% suara.[35]\nPasangan ini berbalik diunggulkan memenangi pemilukada DKI 2012 karena kedekatan Jokowi dengan Hidayat Nur Wahid saat pilkada Wali Kota Solo 2010[36] serta pendukung Faisal Basri dan Alex Noerdin dari hasil survei cenderung beralih kepadanya.[37] Namun keadaan berbalik setelah partai-partai pendukung calon lainnya di putaran pertama malah menyatakan dukungan kepada Fauzi Bowo.[38][39] Jokowi akhirnya mendapat dukungan dari tokoh-tokoh penting seperti Misbakhun dari PKS,[40] Jusuf Kalla dari Partai Golkar,[41] Indra J Piliang dari Partai Golkar,[42] serta Romo Heri yang merupakan adik ipar Fauzi Bowo.[43]\nPertarungan politik juga merambah ke media sosial dengan peluncuran Jasmev,[44] pembentukan media center,[45] serta pemanfaatan media baru seperti Youtube.[46] Putaran kedua juga diwarnai tudingan kampanye hitam yang antara lain berkisar dalam isu SARA,[47] isu kebakaran yang disengaja,[48] korupsi,[49] dan politik transaksional.[50] Pada 29 September 2012, KPUD DKI Jakarta menetapkan pasangan Jokowi - Ahok sebagai gubernur dan wakil gubernur DKI yang baru untuk masa bakti 2012‚Äì2017 menggantikan Fauzi Bowo - Prijanto.[51][52]\nKebijakan Joko Widodo selama menjabat Gubernur DKI Jakarta banyak yang bersifat populis, seperti Kampung Deret, Kartu Jakarta Sehat dan Kartu Jakarta Pintar. Namun beberapa juga mendatangkan keberatan masyarakat, seperti dalam perbaikan saluran air, peremajaan bus kecil, dan sterilisasi jalur busway.\nDi awal menjabat, ia mendahulukan program bantuan sosial melalui Kartu Jakarta Sehat[53] dan Kartu Jakarta Pintar,[54] dan setelah mendapat kendali atas APBD, menjalankan pembenahan saluran air di DKI Jakarta melalui program JEDI. Beberapa program transportasi warisan pemerintahan sebelumnya seperti 6 Ruas Tol dan Monorel terhambat.[55][56] Sebaliknya, ia berkonsentrasi kepada transportasi massal MRT Jakarta,[57] penambahan armada Transjakarta,[58] dan peremajaan bus kecil.[59] Ia juga mengupayakan pengambilalihan pengelolaan Sumber Daya Air melalui akuisisi Aetra dan Palyja.[60]\nIa berperan dalam mengurangi diskriminasi dan nepotisme dalam jenjang karier Pegawai Negeri Sipil di DKI Jakarta melalui penerapan lelang jabatan. Sebagai salah satu dampaknya adalah terpilihnya pejabat dari kalangan minoritas yang mendapat penolakan masyarakat. Misalnya dalam kasus Lurah Susan.[61] Jokowi menyatakan dukungan bagi Lurah Susan.[61]\nPada masa pemerintahannya pula, DKI Jakarta mengadakan beberapa event kreatif seperti Jakarta Night Festival,[62] Pesta rakyat,[63] dan Festival Keraton Sedunia.[64] Ia juga memperbaiki kebersihan lingkungan di Jakarta, antara lain dengan melarang atraksi Topeng Monyet.[65]\nSetelah terpilih sebagai Gubernur DKI Jakarta, popularitas Jokowi melejit berkat rekam jejaknya yang baik dan pendekatannya yang membumi dan pragmatis, seperti yang ditunjukkan melalui program \"blusukan\" untuk memeriksa keadaan di lapangan secara langsung.[11] Akibatnya, Jokowi merajai survei-survei calon presiden dan menyingkirkan kandidat lainnya,[14] sehingga muncul wacana untuk menjadikannya calon presiden.[13] Selama berbulan-bulan wacana tersebut menjadi tidak pasti karena pencalonan Jokowi di PDI-P harus disetujui oleh Ketua Umum PDI-P Megawati Soekarnoputri, dan ia menegaskan baru akan menentukan calon setelah pemilihan umum legislatif pada bulan April.[15] Namun, pada tanggal 14 Maret 2014, Megawati akhirnya menulis langsung surat mandat kepada Jokowi untuk menjadi calon presiden, dan Jokowi mengumumkan bahwa ia bersedia dan siap melaksanakan mandat tersebut untuk maju sebagai calon presiden Republik Indonesia dalam pemilihan umum presiden Indonesia 2014.[66] Selepas pengumuman ini, IHSG dan rupiah naik nilainya, yang dikaitkan dengan sentimen positif investor terhadap berita tersebut.[67]\nPada tanggal 19 Mei 2014, Jokowi mengumumkan bahwa Jusuf Kalla akan menjadi calon wakil presidennya.[68] Pencalonan tersebut didukung oleh koalisi Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan, Partai NasDem, Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa, dan Partai Hanura.[68] Pada hari yang sama, Jokowi dan Jusuf Kalla secara resmi mendaftar di Komisi Pemilihan Umum.[69]\nSetelah mendengar hasil hitung cepat dari berbagai lembaga survei, Jokowi menyatakan kemenangan pada 9 Juli. Namun, lawannya, Prabowo Subianto juga menyatakan kemenangan, membingungkan warga Indonesia.[70] Pada 22 Juli, beberapa jam sebelum pengumuman hasil pilpres, Prabowo mengundurkan diri dari pilpres.[71] KPU pun mengumumkan kemenangan Jokowi berjam-jam kemudian.[71][72] KPU menyatakan Jokowi menang dengan 53,15% suara (70.997.859 pemilih), sementara Prabowo mendapatkan 46,85% (62.576.444 suara),[73] meskipun kubu Prabowo membantah total ini.[74]\nSetelah kemenangannya, Jokowi menyatakan bahwa, tumbuh di bawah rezim Orde Baru yang otoriter dan korup, ia tidak pernah menyangka seseorang dengan latar belakang kelas bawah bisa menjadi presiden. The New York Times melaporkan dia mengatakan \"sekarang, ini sangat mirip dengan Amerika, ya? Ada impian Amerika, dan di sini kita memiliki impian Indonesia\".[75] Jokowi adalah presiden Indonesia pertama yang tidak berasal dari militer atau elite politik, dan menurut komentator politik Salim Said, rakyat memandang Jokowi sebagai \"seseorang yang merupakan tetangga kita, yang memutuskan untuk terjun ke dunia politik dan mencalonkan diri sebagai presiden\".[75]\nJokowi memulai masa kepresidenannya dengan meluncurkan Kartu Indonesia Sehat, Kartu Indonesia Pintar, dan Kartu Keluarga Sejahtera. Upaya ini oleh partai oposisi dianggap untuk meredam sementara kenaikan harga BBM.[76] Jokowi dikritik karena meluncurkan program yang tidak memiliki payung hukum dan melanggar tertib anggaran[77], namun hal ini dibantah oleh Jusuf Kalla, dengan argumen bahwa program kartu tersebut sebenarnya kelanjutan dari program yang sudah ada sehingga anggarannya pun mengikuti program tersebut.[78]\nMulai tanggal 8 November, ia mengikuti beberapa konferensi tingkat tinggi, seperti APEC, Asian Summit, dan G20. Jokowi menuai kontroversi setelah presentasinya di depan pengusaha di APEC. Sebagian mencerca presentasi ini sebagai upaya menjual negara kepada kepentingan asing[79], sementara di lain pihak pidatonya dipuji karena dianggap tepat pada sasaran, dibanding presiden negara lain yang hanya memberi ceramah yang mengambang[80]. Dari APEC, Jokowi berhasil membawa komitmen investasi senilai Rp300 Triliun.[81]\nSekembalinya dari luar negeri, ia menunjuk Faisal Basri sebagai ketua Tim Pemberantasan Mafia Migas, melantik Basuki Tjahaja Purnama sebagai Gubernur DKI Jakarta, dan mengumumkan kenaikan BBM dari Rp6.500 menjadi Rp8500. Kebijakan ini sempat diikuti demonstrasi di berbagai daerah di Indonesia.[82][83] Jokowi ingin mengalihkan dana subsidi tersebut untuk pembangunan infrastruktur dan kesehatan.[84] Di bidang kelautan, Jokowi menginstruksikan perlakuan keras terhadap pencuri ikan ilegal. Selain meminta diadakannya razia, ia juga berharap kapal pelanggar aturan ditenggelamkan.[85] Di bidang pertanian, Jokowi membagikan 1099 unit traktor tangan di Subang dengan harapan menggenjot produksi petani.[86] Ia juga mendorong terjadinya reformasi agraria dengan mendorong petani mendapat sertifikat sehingga dapat menggarap tanah dengan status legal. Ia juga mendorong hak penguasaan adat dan pengolahan hutan untuk kepentingan rakyat dengan konsep perhutanan sosial.[87]\nJokowi mendapat sambutan hangat dan pujian ketika menyampaikan pidato di hadapan peserta peringatan ke 60 tahun Konferensi Asia Afrika pada 22 April 2015. Jokowi menyampaikan perlunya mereformasi PBB dan badan internasional lainnya. Ia dipandang berani mengkritik lembaga prestisius dunia seperti PBB, Dana Moneter Internasional, dan Bank Dunia. Jokowi pun menuai kritik dari peneliti Amerika Serikat karena ia dipandang tidak konsisten dalam mengajak investor asing untuk masuk ke Indonesia.[88]\nDi bidang infrastruktur, Jokowi telah memulai banyak proyek pembangunan untuk mengejar ketertinggalan Indonesia dalam sektor ini, di antaranya adalah Jalan Tol Trans‚ÄìSumatra[89], Tol Solo‚ÄìKertosono[90], pelabuhan Makassar[91], meresmikan operasional terminal Teluk Lamong sebagai bagian dari Greater Surabaya Metropolitan Port[92], dan lain sebagainya.\nPada masanya, tercatat telah terjadi swasembada beras, jagung, bawang merah, dan cabai[93], dengan membandingkan angka produksi yang lebih besar dari kebutuhan. Namun masih ditandai dengan beberapa kali impor untuk alasan memenuhi cadangan dan kepentingan kebutuhan beras dan jagung khusus yang tidak bisa disediakan petani. Indonesia.[butuh rujukan]\nDi depan Joko Widodo dalam pembukaan forum kerja sama ekonomi negara-negara Asia‚ÄìPasifik (APEC) di Da Nang, Vietnam, Donald Trump secara khusus memuji Indonesia sebagai contoh negara yang berhasil mengangkat diri dari keterpurukan melalui institusi domestik dan demokratis.[94]\nJokowi memberikan perhatian khusus bagi Papua. Terlihat dari frekuensi kunjungan yang terhitung sangat sering dibanding presiden sebelumnya, dan banyaknya pembangunan infrastruktur di Papua. Di antaranya adalah pembangunan pasar tradisional dan jalan lintas Papua[95]. Banyak bandara perintis dibangun atau dibenahi sehingga terlihat lebih baik dan kapasitasnya lebih besar. Ia juga menerbitkan Instruksi Presiden (Inpres) Nomor 9 Tahun 2017 tentang Percepatan Pembangunan Kesejahteraan di Provinsi Papua dan Provinsi Papua Barat pada 11 Desember 2017.[96]\nPada kunjungannya ke Papua bulan Mei 2015, Jokowi membebaskan 5 tahanan politik OPM dan membebaskan wartawan asing untuk melakukan peliputan di Papua seperti halnya daerah lain di Indonesia. Jokowi beralasan bahwa Indonesia sudah harus berpikir positif dan saling percaya[97]. Kebijakan Jokowi ini menuai pro dan kontra, terutama di kalangan DPR RI yang menyatakan bahwa kebijakan tersebut dapat membuat isu Papua dipolitisir ke dunia luar, karena masalah Papua yang sangat sensitif.[98]\nPada 2018, Jokowi mengumumkan bahwa ia akan mencalonkan diri dalam pemilihan umum presiden 2019. Wakil presiden Jusuf Kalla dianggap tidak memenuhi syarat untuk mencalonkan lagi karena batasan masa jabatan yang ditentukan untuk jabatan presiden dan wakil presiden. (Jusuf Kalla telah menjalani masa jabatan lima tahun sebagai wakil presiden pada masa kepresidenan Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) dari 2004 hingga 2009.) Spekulasi mengenai siapa yang akan dipilih Jokowi sebagai calon wakil presidennya terfokus pada beberapa kandidat termasuk Mahfud MD, seorang mantan menteri pertahanan dan hakim agung Mahkamah Konstitusi.\nPada 9 Agustus 2018, secara mengejutkan, Jokowi mengumumkan bahwa Ma'ruf Amin akan menjadi pasangannya. Mahfud telah dilaporkan sedang mempersiapkan diri untuk menjadi calon wakil presiden, namun, setelah dorongan oleh beberapa partai dari koalisi pemerintah Jokowi dan tokoh-tokoh Islam yang berpengaruh, Ma'ruf dipilih sebagai gantinya.[99] Jokowi memilih Ma'ruf karena pengalamannya yang luas dalam urusan pemerintahan dan agama.[100]\nPada Januari 2019, diberitakan bahwa Jokowi sedang mempertimbangkan pembebasan Abu Bakar Ba'asyir karena usia tua dan kesehatan yang menurun. Langkah ini dipandang kontroversial sebagai bagian dari semakin banyaknya tindakan yang diambil oleh Jokowi untuk menenangkan hati orang Muslim konservatif menjelang pemilihan.[101] Rencana itu dibatalkan pada tanggal 23 Januari, karena Ba'asyir menolak untuk berjanji setia pada ideologi negara Pancasila yang merupakan salah satu syarat pembebasannya.[102] Jokowi telah menolak untuk memberikan pandangan pada penahanan sekitar 1.000.000 Muslim Uighur oleh pemerintah Tiongkok di kamp-kamp pendidikan ulang di provinsi Xinjiang dengan menyatakan \"Saya tidak tahu tentang Xinjiang\" dan tidak memberikan komentar.[103][104][105][106][107]\nSetelah empat tahun menjabat, tingkat kepuasan publik terhadap Jokowi tetap tinggi, berkisar antara 60‚Äì70%.[108][109] Hasil hitung cepat menunjukkan bahwa Jokowi diperkirakan memenangkan pilpres dengan suara 54 persen.[110] Akan tetapi, Prabowo mengklaim bahwa perhitungan oleh tim kampanyenya sendiri menunjukkan bahwa dia meraih suara 62 persen.[111][112]\nJokowi memeluk agama Islam dan bercerita bahwa ia pertama kali naik haji pada tahun 2003, dan sesudahnya umrah minimal empat kali.[113] Namun, menjelang pemilihan umum presiden 2014, muncul berbagai tudingan yang mempertanyakan keislaman Jokowi, sehingga pada tanggal 24 Mei 2014 Jokowi menyatakan bahwa ia adalah bagian dari \"Islam yang rahmatan lil alamin, Islam yang hidup berketurunan dan berkarya di negara RI yang memegang teguh UUD 45.\"[114] Ia juga menyatakan bahwa ia bukan bagian dari kelompok Islam yang \"sesuka hatinya mengafirkan saudaranya sendiri\", \"menindas agama lain\", \"arogan dan menghunus pedang di tangan dan di mulut\", \"suka menjejerkan fustun-fustunnya\", \"menutupi perampokan hartanya, menutupi pedang berlumuran darah dengan gamis dan serban\", atau \"membawa ayat-ayat Tuhan untuk menipu rakyat\".[114]\nSebagai Presiden Indonesia terpilih, Jokowi menegaskan sikap politiknya untuk memimpin Indonesia dengan kekayaan manusia, budaya, dan pluralitasnya supaya tidak kehilangan arah dalam mengejawantahkan isi UUD 1945 dan makna Pancasila. Sikap ini menurutnya juga dipandang perlu diimplementasikan oleh setiap pemimpin pada semua level pemerintahan baik kota hingga skala nasional. Jokowi memilih memaknai lewat ajaran trisakti Bung Karno yakni berdaulat di bidang politik, berdikari di bidang ekonomi, dan berkepribadian nasional di bidang kebudayaan.[115]\n\"Saya sebagai seorang Presiden juga harus punya ideologi jelas, apa itu? Berdaulat, berdikari dan berkepribadian. Ideologi kita sama, Pancasila, tetapi cara penerapannya berbeda. Ada yang lewat gerakan perubahan restorasi Indonesia, ada yang lewat cara cara lain. Seorang pemimpin baik di kota, kabupaten, gubernur provinsi, tingkat nasional, memimpin itu harus punya ideologi. Harus ada ideologinya. Tanpa itu kita tak punya arah.\" [115]\nAtas prestasinya, oleh Majalah Tempo, Joko Widodo terpilih menjadi salah satu dari \"10 Tokoh 2008\".[116] Kebetulan di majalah yang sama pula, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, atau akrab dengan panggilan Ahok pernah terpilih juga dalam \"10 Tokoh 2006\" atas jasanya memperbaiki layanan kesehatan dan pendidikan di Belitung Timur. Ahok kemudian menjadi pendampingnya di Pilgub DKI tahun 2012.[117]\nIa juga mendapat penghargaan internasional dari Kemitraan Pemerintahan Lokal Demokratis Asia Tenggara (Delgosea) ini atas keberhasilan Solo melakukan relokasi yang manusiawi dan pemberdayaan pedagang kaki lima.[118]\nPada tanggal 12 Agustus 2011, ia juga mendapat penghargaan Bintang Jasa Utama untuk prestasinya sebagai kepala daerah mengabdikan diri kepada rakyat.[119] Bintang Jasa Utama ini adalah penghargaan tertinggi yang diberikan kepada warga negara sipil.[120] Pada Januari 2013, Joko Widodo dinobatkan sebagai wali kota terbaik ke-3 di dunia atas keberhasilannya dalam memimpin Surakarta sebagai kota seni dan budaya, kota paling bersih dari korupsi, serta kota yang paling baik penataannya.[121] Oleh KPK, dia diberi penghargaan atas keberaniannya melaporkan berbagai barang gratifikasi yang diterima.[122]\nAtas kemampuannya mensosialisasikan program-progam pemerintah sehingga mendapat dukungan masyarakat banyak, ia diganjar sebagai Marketer of The Year 2012 oleh Markplus Conference 2013, Marketing: Into Innovation and Technology.[123]\nJokowi dikenal akan gaya kepemimpinannya yang pragmatis dan membumi. Ia sering kali melakukan \"blusukan\" atau turun langsung ke lapangan untuk melihat langsung permasalahan yang ada dan mencari solusi yang tepat. \"Blusukan\" juga dilakukan untuk menemui langsung warga dan mendengar keluh kesah mereka. Gaya yang unik ini dijuluki The New York Times sebagai \"demokrasi jalanan\".[133] Jokowi juga dianggap unik dari pemimpin lainnya karena tidak sungkan untuk bertanya langsung kepada warga dan mendekati mereka bila akan melancarkan suatu program.[134] Namun, gaya ini juga menuai kritik. Misalnya, ketua Dewan Perwakilan Daerah Irman Gusman menyatakan bahwa \"blusukan\" hanya menghabiskan waktu dan energi, sementara yang dibutuhkan adalah kebijakan langsung dan bukan sekadar interaksi.[135] Anies Baswedan juga menilai \"blusukan\" merupakan pencitraan belaka tanpa memberikan solusi.[136]\nSelain \"blusukan\", kepemimpinan Jokowi juga dikenal akan transparansinya. Misalnya, Joko Widodo dan Basuki Tjahaja Purnama sama-sama mengumumkan jumlah gaji bulanan dan Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Daerah kepada umum.[137][138] Ia juga memulai sejumlah program yang terkait dengan transparansi seperti online tax, e-budgeting, e-purchasing, dan cash management system.[137] Selain itu, semua rapat dan kegiatan yang dihadiri oleh Jokowi dan Basuki direkam dan diunggah ke akun \"Pemprov DKI\" di YouTube.[139]\nGaya berkampanye Jokowi untuk menjadi Gubernur DKI Jakarta menekankan pendekatan langsung kepada masyarakat dengan mendatangi mereka langsung daripada mengumpulkan orang di lapangan.[140] Jokowi mengklaim bahwa ia menghindari pemasangan spanduk, poster, stiker, dan baliho di taman kota atau jalan karena menurutnya dapat mengotori kota, sehingga ia secara langsung mencopot spanduk di depan bioskop Megaria, Jalan Diponegoro.[141] Selama kampanye pilkada Jakarta, Jokowi juga dikenal akan baju kotak-kotaknya, yang menurutnya dibeli satu jam sebelum berangkat ke Komisi Pemilihan Umum Daerah dan dikatakan mewakili \"warna-warni Jakarta yang harus diakomodasi\".[142]\nSalah satu kekuatan Jokowi dalam berkampanye adalah penggunaan media sosial. Selama kampanye pilkada Jakarta, ia meluncurkan Jasmev atau Jokowi Ahok Social Media Volunteer, yang merupakan jaringan antar kelompok sukarelawan tanpa bayaran.[44] Selain itu, Jokowi juga membentuk media center[45] dan mampu memanfaatkan Youtube sebagai wadah kampanye baru.[46] Pihak Fauzi Bowo sendiri mengakui keunggulan Jokowi di kanal ini.[143]\nBerdasarkan hasil audit Komisi Pemilihan Umum DKI Jakarta pada Agustus 2012, pemasukkan dana kampanye pasangan Jokowi-Basuki tercatat sebesar Rp16,31 miliar, sementara pengeluarannya mencapai Rp16,09 miliar.[144] Sebagian besar dana dialokasikan untuk spanduk, alat peraga, dan bahan kampanye, dengan biaya penyebaran bahan kampanye sebesar Rp4,2 miliar, alat peraga sebesar Rp2,6 miliar, dan rapat umum sebesar Rp2,1 miliar.[144] Biaya iklan cetak sendiri tercatat sebesar Rp729 juta, sementara biaya iklan radio mencapai Rp516 juta.[144] Jokowi mengklaim bahwa sebagian besar dana digunakan untuk kampanye \"murah\" dengan sasaran rakyat kecil.[144] Sebagai perbandingan, pengeluaran kampanye Fauzi Bowo tercatat sebesar Rp62,57 miliar, sementara pemasukkan dana kampanyenya mencapai Rp62,63 miliar.[144]\nBerkat kampanyenya selama pemilihan umum Gubernur DKI Jakarta 2012 yang menjanjikan \"Jakarta Baru\", ia melejit menjadi tokoh nasional yang dikenal bersih, merakyat, dan mampu menyelesaikan masalah.[145] Namun, menjelang pemilihan umum presiden Indonesia 2014, dugaan keterlibatan Joko Widodo dalam kasus TransJakarta dikatakan mengganjal elektabilitas Joko Widodo.[146] Selain itu, akibat gencarnya kampanye hitam, menurut Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting tren kesukaan masyarakat terhadap Jokowi menurun hingga 8% sampai April 2014.[147]\nMantan tim sukses Jokowi diduga terlibat dalam kasus busway berkarat, bahkan keluarga Jokowi dituduh menerima aliran dana busway berkarat. Namun, Jokowi membantah hal tersebut,[148][149][150] dan Jaksa Agung Basrief Arief menegaskan bahwa kasus ini \"belum atau boleh dikatakan tidak menyangkut kepada Jokowi\".[151] Jokowi juga dikritik karena tidak mematuhi janjinya untuk menyelesaikan masa jabatannya sebagai gubernur Jakarta,[152] walaupun Jokowi sendiri menyatakan bahwa bila ia menjadi presiden, akan lebih mudah mengurus Jakarta karena memiliki wewenang terhadap proyek pemerintah pusat di ibu kota.[153] Ada anggapan bahwa Jokowi termasuk gagal mengatasi banjir dan macet.[154][155] Anggapan bahwa Jokowi gagal dalam mengatasi banjir dan macet di Jakarta membuat popularitasnya menurun.[156] Data dari BPS juga menunjukkan angka kemiskinan di Solo naik saat Jokowi menjadi wali kota Solo.[157] Melesatnya popularitas Jokowi juga dikritik sebagai pengaruh media yang kerap menonjolkan kebaikan Jokowi sementara kelemahannya ditutupi.[158][159] Selain itu, Jokowi didapati menaiki pesawat jet pribadi untuk berkampanye dari Banjarmasin ke Kota Malang, yang dianggap bertentangan dengan gaya hidup sederhana.[160] Sementara itu, Guru Besar Ekonomi Universitas Indonesia Taufik Bahauddin mengkhawatirkan kontroversi yang terjadi pada pemerintahan Megawati seperti skandal BLBI, penjualan BUMN, penjualan kapal tanker VLCC Pertamina dan penjualan gas murah ke China akan terulang pada pemerintahan Jokowi.[161]\n\nDia kembali menuai kontroversi setelah menunjuk HM Prasetyo sebagai Jaksa Agung. HM Prasetyo dinilai tidak punya pengalaman cukup baik di kejaksaan dan dianggap sebagai titipan partai politik.[162] Dia juga dinilai tidak konsisten karena mengangkat Airlangga Hartarto, Ketua Umum Partai Golkar sebagai Menteri Perindustrian, setelah awalnya meminta menteri tidak rangkap jabatan sebagai pengurus partai politik.[163] Sebelumnya Puan Maharani juga menjabat Ketua DPP PDIP beberapa waktu saat menjabat sebagai Menteri Koordinator Pengembangan Manusia dan Kebudayaan.\nKemunculan nama Jokowi pada soal Ujian Nasional[164] dan kedatangan Jokowi di kampus ITB[165] juga menuai kontroversi karena dinilai sebagai tindakan politisasi.\nPada masa kepresidenannya, Jokowi juga menuai kecaman setelah salah menyebutkan kota tempat kelahiran Presiden RI pertama Ir. Soekarno dalam pidatonya di alun-alun Kota Blitar pada tanggal 1 Juni 2015. Jokowi menyebutkan Soekarno lahir di Blitar, namun secara sejarah Soekarno dilahirkan di Jalan Pandean, Peneleh, Kota Surabaya. Beragam kritik pun dialamatkan kepada bawahannya seperti Setneg dan Tim Komunikasi Presiden akibat memberikan bahan yang salah kepada Presiden.[166]\nJokowi kembali menuai kontroversi dan protes luas dari berbagai elemen masyarakat ketika mengajukan calon tunggal Kapolri Komisaris Jenderal Polisi Budi Gunawan ke DPR pada pertengahan Januari 2015. Budi dianggap sebagai calon Kapolri yang tidak bersih oleh publik serta pernah menjadi ajudan mantan Presiden Megawati Soekarnoputri yang dianggap sebagai politik balas jasa. Sehari sebelum disahkan sebagai calon Kapolri oleh DPR, Budi Gunawan ditetapkan sebagai tersangka oleh KPK atas kasus dugaan rekening gendut. Presiden Jokowi lalu memutuskan untuk menunda pelantikannya sebagai Kapolri hingga proses hukum yang membelit Budi Gunawan selesai serta menunjuk Wakapolri Komjen Pol Badrodin Haiti untuk melaksanakan tugas sehari-hari Kapolri.[167] Pada akhirnya Badrodin Haiti resmi dilantik menjadi Kapolri oleh Presiden Jokowi pada tanggal 17 April 2015,[168] lalu digantikan Tito Karnavian, sementara Budi Gunawan menempati posisi Kepala BIN.\nPresiden Jokowi juga kembali menuai kecaman keras setelah menandatangani Peraturan Presiden tentang Kenaikan Uang Muka Mobil Pejabat. Jokowi pun mengaku tidak tahu Perpres yang ditandatanganinya dan akhirnya mencabut Peraturan tersebut.[169] Namun terlanjur menghasilkan tertawaan \"I Don't Read What I Sign\".\nKarena merupakan pemimpin yang muncul di masa maraknya penggunaan media sosial, Joko Widodo adalah salah satu tokoh yang sering diserang dengan pemberitaan palsu, di antaranya adalah memiliki orang tua Tionghoa, non-muslim, keluarga keturunan PKI, menantu hamil di luar nikah, dan lainnya.\nWali Kota Surakarta Joko Widodo sedang blusukan ke sebuah pasar.\nJokowi bersama dengan Sinuhun Pakubuwana XIII Raja Surakarta.\nGubernur Joko Widodo saat melakukan blusukan ke pasar, 2013.\nGubernur Joko Widodo saat mengunjungi sebuah kampung bersama Duta Besar Amerika Serikat untuk Indonesia Marciel Joins, 2013.\nPresiden Jokowi sesaat setelah pelantikan presiden, 2014.\nPresiden Joko Widodo dan Presiden Rusia Vladimir Putin, 2016.\nPresiden Joko Widodo blusukan bersama Presiden Filipina Rodrigo Duterte, 2016\nPresiden Joko Widodo dan Raja Arab Saudi Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, 2017.\nPresiden Joko Widodo saat dikalungi dengan sarung oleh Maimun Zubair, 2019.\n",

        "text": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Joko Widodo ]*\n\n\n\n\n\nJoko Widodo (Indonesian pronunciation:¬†[d í…îk…î wid…îd…î], born 21 June 1961), also known as Jokowi, is an Indonesian politician and businessman who is the 7th and current president of Indonesia. Elected in July 2014 as the first president not to come from an elite political or military background, he was previously the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 and the Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014. Prior to his political career, he was an industrialist and businessman.[2][3]\nHe achieved national prominence in 2009 for his work as the Mayor of Surakarta. A member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), he was named as the party's candidate for the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election, alongside Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok)[4] as his running mate.[5] Defeating incumbent Fauzi Bowo,[6] he took office in October 2012 and reinvigorated Jakartan politics, introducing publicised blusukan visits (unannounced spot checks)[7] and improving the city's bureaucracy, reducing corruption in the process. He also introduced years-late programs to improve quality of life, including universal healthcare, dredging the city's main river to reduce flooding, and inaugurating the construction of the city's subway system.[8]\nThe PDI-P nominated Jokowi, who was already seen as a rising star in Indonesian politics, for the 2014 presidential election.[9] Winning a majority of the popular vote, he was named president-elect on 22 July 2014, to bitter protest from his opponent Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.[10][11] As president, Jokowi has primarily focused on infrastructure, introducing or restarting long-delayed programs to improve connectivity in the Indonesian archipelago.[12] On foreign policy, his administration has emphasised \"protecting Indonesia‚Äôs sovereignty\",[13] with the sinking of illegal foreign fishing vessels[14] and the prioritising and scheduling  of capital punishment for drug smugglers. The latter was despite intense representations and diplomatic protests from foreign powers, including Australia and France.[15][16] He was re-elected in 2019 for a second five-year term, again defeating Prabowo Subianto.[17]\nJoko Widodo was born Mulyono on 21 June 1961 in Surakarta[1] and is of Javanese descent.[18] He is the eldest of four siblings and is the only son of Noto Mihardjo (father) and Sudjiatmi Notomihardjo (mother). He has three younger sisters, named Iit Sriyantini, Ida Yati, and Titik Relawati.[19][20] His father came from Karanganyar, while his grandparents came from a village in Boyolali.[21] Jokowi was often sick as a toddler, and his name was thus changed‚Äîa common practice in Javanese culture‚Äîto Joko Widodo, with widodo meaning \"healthy\" in Javanese.[18] At the age of 12, he started working in his father's furniture workshop.[22][23] Throughout his childhood, Jokowi's family constantly faced evictions from their landlords; this greatly affected him, and later in his career, he organised medical housing in Surakarta during his years as mayor of the city.[24]\nJokowi's education began at State Elementary School 111 Tirtoyoso, known for being a school for less wealthy citizens.[25] He continued his studies in State Junior High School 1 Surakarta,[26] and later wanted to attend State Senior High School 1 Surakarta, but failed the entrance exam and instead enrolled in State Senior High School 6 Surakarta.[27] Jokowi graduated from the Forestry faculty at Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, in 1985, where his work included studies and research on the use of plywood. He later began work at PT Kertas Kraft Aceh (id), a state-owned firm in Aceh, Sumatra.[28] He worked in the present-day Bener Meriah Regency between 1986 and 1988 as a supervisor of forestry and raw materials of a Pinus merkusii plantation.[29][30]\nJokowi, however, soon became uninterested in his activities in the firm and returned home. He began working in his grandfather's furniture factory for a year before establishing his own company, Rakabu, whose namesake is his first child. The company, which mainly focused on teak furniture, nearly went bankrupt at one point but survived following an IDR 500 million loan from Perusahaan Gas Negara. By 1991, the company began exporting its products, and they were successful in international markets. The firm first established a presence in the European market in France, and it was a French customer named Bernard who gave Joko Widodo the nickname \"Jokowi\".[28][31][3]\nBy 2002, Jokowi had become the chairman of Surakarta's furniture manufacturers association.[3] Ultimately he decided to become a politician and promote reform in his home town, Surakarta, after seeing the neat layouts of some European cities while promoting his furniture there.[23] After becoming mayor, he also made a joint venture with politician and former lieutenant general Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, when the two founded PT Rakabu Sejahtera (from Rakabu and Luhut's PT Toba Sejahtera).[32][33]\nJokowi reported his net worth in 2018 to be Rp 50.25 billion (US$3.5 million), mostly in the form of property holdings in Central Java and Jakarta.[34]\nAfter first joining PDI-P in 2004, Jokowi ran in the mayoral race in Surakarta in 2005 with F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo as his running mate, with the support of PDI-P and the National Awakening Party.[35][36] The pair won 36.62% of the vote against the incumbent Slamet Suryanto and two other candidates. During the campaign, many questioned his background as a property and furniture businessman. However, one academic paper claimed his leadership style was successful because it established an interactive relationship with the people, through which he was able to induce people's strong faith in him.[37] He adopted the development framework of European cities (which he frequently travelled to as a businessman) as a guide for changes in Surakarta.[38]\nHis notable policies as mayor included:[39] Building new traditional markets and renovating existing markets, constructing a 7-km city walk with a 3-meter wide pedestrian walkway along Surakarta's main street, revitalising the Balekambang and Sriwedari parks, employing stricter regulations on cutting down trees along the city's main streets, rebranding the city as a centre of Javanese culture and tourism under the tagline 'The Spirit of Java', promoting the city as a centre for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE), launching healthcare and education insurance program for all residents, a local bus rapid transit system named Batik Solo Trans and a Solo Techno Park, which helped support the Esemka Indonesian car project.[40] It was during his tenure as mayor that he conducted the blusukan, an impromptu visit to specific areas to listen to people's issues, which proved popular later in his political career. He also prohibited his family members from bidding for city projects, therefore suppressing the risk of corruption. His policies brought him into conflict with then provincial governor Bibit Waluyo, who on one occasion called Jokowi a \"fool\" for the latter's opposition to a provincial construction project in Surakarta.[41]\nHis supporters pointed to rapid positive changes in Surakarta under his leadership and the city's branding with the motto 'Solo: The Spirit of Java'. While in office, he successfully relocated antique stalls in the Banjarsari Gardens without incident, a helpful move in revitalising the functions of the open green land; he emphasised the importance of business firms engaging in community activities; he improved communications with the local community by appearing regularly on local television. As a follow-up of the city's new branding, he applied for Surakarta to become a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities, which was approved in 2006, and subsequently had the city chosen to host the organisation's conference in October 2008. In 2007, Surakarta had also hosted the World Music Festival (Festival Musik Dunia/FMD), held at the complex of Fort Vastenburg near the centre of the city. The following year, it was held in the Mangkunegaran Palace Complex.\nPart of Jokowi's style was his populist 'can-do' (punya gaye) elements designed to build bonds with the broad electorate.[37] As mayor, he became personally involved in an incident just before Christmas 2011 when the Surakarta municipality had overdue bills of close to $1 million (IDR 8.9 billion) owed to the state-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). Following its policy of pursuing a more disciplined approach to collecting overdue bills, it imposed a blackout on street lights in the city just before Christmas. The city government quickly authorised payment, but in settling the bill, protested that the PLN should consider the public interest before taking such action. To reinforce the point, Jokowi made a highly publicised personal visit to the local PLN office to deliver the IDR 8.9 billion in cash in the form of hundreds of bundles of notes and even small coins.[42]\nIn 2010, he was re-elected for a second term, again running with Hadi. They won 90.09% of the vote, losing in only a single polling station.[43] He was later chosen as the 'Tempo Leader of Choice' by Tempo news magazine (2008) and received a 'Changemakers Award' from Republika newspaper (2010); his name also started being considered in national polls for the governorship of Jakarta, long before PDI-P's nomination, including those by University of Indonesia and Cyrus Network (2011).[37]\nIn 2012, Jokowi faced a smear campaign after declaring his intention to run for the governorship of Jakarta.[44] A group calling itself Save Solo, Save Jakarta and Save Indonesia Team (TS3) reported him to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) for allegedly having facilitated misuse of education funds by his subordinates in Surakarta in 2010. The KPK investigated the allegation, found it was based on false data and said there was no indication Jokowi had misappropriated funds.[45]\nDespite disappointment from some Surakarta residents that he would not complete his second term as mayor,[46] Jokowi ran in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election and defeated the incumbent Fauzi Bowo in a runoff round.[6] His inner circle of advisers in Jakarta reportedly included people such as FX Hadi 'Rudy' Rudyatmo, Sumartono Hadinoto and Anggit Nugroho, who were colleagues while he was mayor of Surakarta, as well as Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (\"Ahok\"), his deputy as governor of Jakarta.[47][48] Jokowi continued the blusukan practice he had adopted as mayor of Surakarta by regularly visiting population centers, especially slums. During these visits, he wore simple, informal clothes and stopped at markets or walked along narrow Jakarta alleys to listen and witness firsthand issues addressed by residents, such as the price of food, housing difficulties, flooding, and transportation. Polling and media coverage suggested that his hands-on style proved very popular both in Jakarta and elsewhere across Indonesia.[49]\nAfter taking office, taxes and Jakarta's provincial budget increased significantly from IDR 41 trillion in 2012 to IDR 72 trillion in 2014.[50][51] Both Jokowi and Ahok publicised their monthly salary and the provincial budget.[52][53] They also initiated programs aimed towards transparency, such as online taxes, e-budgeting, e-purchasing, and a cash management system.[52] Moreover, all meetings and activities that Jokowi and Ahok attended were recorded and uploaded on YouTube.[54]\nIn healthcare, Jokowi introduced a universal health care program, the 'Healthy Jakarta Card' (Kartu Jakarta Sehat, KJS).[55] It involved an insurance program provided through state-owned insurance company PT Askes Indonesia (Persero) and a plan to regulate health charges for treatment for over 20,000 services and procedures.[56] The program was criticised for confusion over details of the implementation and long queues,[57] though Jokowi defended it and counselled patience. In education, Jokowi launched the 'Smart Jakarta Card' (Kartu Jakarta Pintar, KJP) on 1 December 2012 to help needy students. It gives an allowance that can be withdrawn from ATMs for buying school needs such as books and uniforms.[58]\nHis administration's other notable policies include a system of bureaucratic recruitment called lelang jabatan (literally 'auction of office position'), giving every civil servant the same opportunity to achieve a certain position by fulfilling the required qualifications,[59] regulation of the chaotic agglomeration of street vendors in Pasar Minggu and Pasar Tanah Abang,[60][61] the dredging and reservoir normalisation projects to reduce flooding,[62][63][64] and the inauguration of long-delayed Jakarta MRT and Jakarta LRT.[65][66] As governor, Jokowi also appointed a non-Muslim 'lurah' (subdistrict chief) for the Muslim-majority subdistrict of Lenteng Agung despite protests by some residents.[67] Former deputy governor Prijanto claimed that Widodo had carried out maladministration when abusing government certificate asset of BMW Park by formalising another expired certificate.[68]\nIn 2013, Jokowi was reported to the National Commission on Human Rights over the eviction of the squatters near Pluit. In previous \"political contracts\", he had vowed not to evict residents to distant locations.[69][70] Jokowi met with Pluit residents and Komnas HAM to explain the evictions were necessary for restoring water catchment to reduce flooding and that families were being relocated to low-cost apartments.[71][72]\nMegawati Sukarnoputri nominated Jokowi to be the presidential candidate of her party.[9] During the campaign, a social media volunteer team, JASMEV, once made a provocative statement by threatening that Islam would not be given a space in Indonesia if Jokowi won the 2014 election.[73][74] The group was paid IDR 500 million to campaign for the Jokowi-Jusuf Kalla ticket during the 2014 election.[75]\nFollowing the release of Quick Count results from many different polls, Jokowi declared victory on 9 July. However, his opponent Prabowo Subianto also declared victory, creating confusion among the population.[76] On 22 July, hours before the announcement of the election results, Prabowo withdrew.[77] Jokowi's victory was expected and realised hours later.[78][77] The General Elections Commission (KPU) gave him a close victory with 53.15% of the vote (almost 71 million votes), to Prabowo's 46.85% (62 million votes),[79] though Prabowo's camp disputed these totals.[80]\nAfter his victory, Jokowi stated that growing up under the authoritarian and corrupt New Order regime, he would have never expected someone with a lower-class background to become president. The New York Times reported him as saying, \"now, it's quite similar to America, yeah? There is the American dream, and here we have the Indonesian dream\".[81] Jokowi was the first Indonesian president outside the military or the political elite, and the political commentator Salim Said gave the popular view of the politician as \"someone who is our neighbour, who decided to get into politics and run for president.\"[81]\nIn 2018, Jokowi announced that he would run for re-election next year. His vice president Jusuf Kalla was not eligible for another term because of the term limits set for president and vice president. Kalla had already served a five-year term as vice president during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's first term (2004-2009). Speculation surrounding Jokowi's choice of running mate focused on several candidates, including Mahfud MD, a former defence minister and chief justice of the Constitutional Court. In a surprise move, Jokowi announced that Ma'ruf Amin would be his running mate. Mahfud had reportedly been preparing for the vice-presidential candidacy. Ma'ruf was selected instead following a push by several constituent parties of Jokowi's governing coalition and influential Islamic figures.[82] Explaining his decision, Jokowi referred to Ma'ruf's extensive experience in government and religious affairs.[83]\nThe KPU officially announced that the Jokowi-Amin ticket had won the election in the early hours of 21 May 2019.[84] The official vote tally was 85 million votes for Jokowi (55.50%) and 68 million votes for Prabowo (44.50%).[85] Supporters of Prabowo protested in Jakarta against the result, and it turned into a riot which left eight people dead and over 600 injured.[86] Following the protests, Prabowo's campaign team launched a Constitutional Court lawsuit but was rejected in its entirety.[87]\nDespite vowing not to give government positions simply to political allies during the 2014 campaign, many members of political parties received ministerial positions in Jokowi's first cabinet.[88][89] The first year of Jokowi's administration saw him controlling a minority government until Golkar, the second-largest party in the People's Representative Council (DPR), switched from opposition to the government. Jokowi denied accusations of interfering with Golkar's internal affairs, although he admitted that Luhut might have influenced the change.[90] His cabinet's Minister of Industry Airlangga Hartarto was elected chairman of Golkar in 2018.[91] The National Mandate Party (PAN) had also switched sides beforehand but later returned to being the opposition in 2018.[92][93]\nJokowi announced the 34 names in his cabinet on 26 October 2014.[94] While it was praised for the inclusiveness of women, with Retno Marsudi becoming Indonesia's first female foreign minister, it received criticism for several perceived political inclusions, such as Puan Maharani (daughter of Megawati Sukarnoputri).[95] The Jokowi administration also saw the formation of two new ministries (Ministry of Public Works and Housing and Ministry of Environment and Forestry) from a merger of old ministries, in addition to renaming and reorganisation of other ministries.[96] He conducted a total of three cabinet reshuffles until 2018, removing ministers such as Rizal Ramli and Bambang Brodjonegoro while including ministers such as Luhut and World Bank Director Sri Mulyani Indrawati.[97] Another reshuffle occurred in December 2020, replacing six ministers including two apprehended by the KPK.[98]\nHe was criticised by PDI-P over perceived policy weaknesses, and PDI-P legislator Effendi Simbolon called for his impeachment.[99] On 9 April 2015, during a PDI-P Congress, party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri referred to Jokowi as a functionary. She noted that presidential candidates are nominated by political parties, hinting that Jokowi owed his position to the party and should carry out its policy line.[100][101] Several months prior, Megawati and Jokowi had disputed over the appointment of a new police chief, with Megawati supporting her former adjutant Budi Gunawan while Jokowi supported Badrodin Haiti.[90][102][103]\nFollowing his re-election, Jokowi announced his second cabinet on 23 October 2019. He retained several ministers such as Sri Mulyani and Luhut but also included Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim and two-time presidential rival Prabowo Subianto as education and defence ministers, respectively.[104]\nIn the first year of his second presidential term, his approval rating fell to 45.2%, and the disapproval rating was 52%.[105][106] His deputy, Ma'ruf Amin, had a 67% disapproval rating. The low ratings were attributed to unpopular policies.\nBefore taking office, Jokowi sought for outgoing President SBY to take responsibility for the decision to further increase fuel prices[107] by further removing subsidies.[108] Previous attempts by SBY to do so had resulted in civil unrest.[107] On 1 January 2015, Jokowi took measures that, on the surface, appeared to reduce fuel subsidies.[109][110] The policy stirred up some demonstrations, with Jokowi citing it as necessary to increase funding for the infrastructure, education and health sectors.[111] However, since March 2015, the government has set the price of Premium-branded gasoline far below the market price, causing the fuel subsidy to be incurred by state-owned oil company Pertamina instead of the direct government account.[112] Additionally, the government also implemented a single-price program, aiming to sell fuel through official channels at the same price nationally, including in isolated parts of Kalimantan and Papua. The government claimed that this was achieved in 2017.[113]\nIn the first quarter of 2015, year-on-year GDP grew 4.92%, and in the second quarter, it grew 4.6%, the lowest figure since 2009.[114][115][116] Since then, growth has remained above the 5% mark, which is still below what is considered a healthy economic growth mark of 6%.[117] The Indonesian rupiah (IDR) has also weakened throughout Jokowi's administration, with its exchange rate per US dollar briefly passing IDR 15,000 in 2018, the lowest level since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and sank lower to 16,700 in 2020.[118][119] The year-on-year inflation in June 2015 was 7.26%, higher than in May (7.15%) and June the year before (6.7%).[120]\nJokowi's administration continued the resource nationalism policy of its predecessor, nationalising some assets controlled by multinational companies such as Freeport McMoRan, Total SA and Chevron. In 2018, in a move aimed to cut imports, oil companies operating in Indonesia were ordered to sell their crude oil to state-owned Pertamina.[121] A ban was also enforced on the exports of raw nickel ore, intended to help promote the development of local nickel-related industries such as smelters and battery factories.[122]\nInfrastructure development has been a significant feature of the Jokowi administration, focusing on road and railway expansion, seaports and airports development, and irrigation. In 2016, the state budget allocated Rp 290 trillion (US$22 billion) for infrastructure, the biggest in Indonesian history.[123] In total, his administration planned 265 infrastructure projects starting in 2016.[124] In September 2015, Indonesia awarded a $5.5 billion high-speed rail project to China,[125][126] to Japan's disappointment, which is also vying for the project.[127] Indonesia's transportation ministry laid out a litany of shortcomings in plans for the project, casting doubt on the project and spotlighting Jokowi's limits in turning mega-projects into reality as he tries to draw foreign investors.[128] Other significant projects include the completion of the 4,325-kilometer Trans Papua road and the Trans-Java Toll Road,[129][130] initial construction of the Trans-Sulawesi Railway[131] and the Trans-Sumatra Toll Road,[132] a US$50 billion plan to develop the maritime sector including 24 \"strategic ports\",[133] and expansion of airport capacity in remote areas.[134] The ports' development and modernisation program, dubbed the \"Sea Toll Road\" program, was aimed to reduce price inequality between the better developed western parts of the country and the less populated eastern parts.[135]\nIn addition to the major projects, the Jokowi administration also implemented a village fund program in which villages across the country received funding to allocate on basic infrastructures such as roads and water supply, tourism development and village enterprises to improve rural economies.[136][137] The initial campaign promise was that IDR 1.4 billion (around US$100,000) would be allocated for every village annually,[138] though as of 2019, less than a billion was allocated.[139] Between 2015 and 2018, IDR 187 trillion (US$14 billion) had been reallocated through the program.[140] The administration has targeted to streamline land certification across the country, aiming to distribute certificates of land ownership across the country completely. It involved increasing the issuing rate of certificates from around 500,000 to several million annually.[141][142] In 2016, the administration signed into law a tax amnesty bill following a lengthy public debate and push back, giving wealthy Indonesians a chance to declare their unreported assets before the government would strengthen rules and oversight around imports and exports. It became the most successful program of its kind in history, with over IDR 4,865 trillion (approximately US$366 billion) of previously unreported assets declared to the tax office.[143][144]\nThe opposition criticised the aggressive spending on infrastructure as it increased Indonesia's national debt by 48% between 2014 and March 2018 to US$181 billion. They also pointed out that most of the debt was allocated for remunerations rather than infrastructure development.[145][146][147] In April 2018, Jokowi also issued a new policy that allows foreign workers in Indonesia without Indonesian language skills requirement,[148] reasoning that it would increase investments.[149] The policy faced significant opposition from local labour unions, who claimed that the policy would increase unemployment rates.[150][151]\nIn 2020, the DPR passed the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. Though intended to boost investment and reduce red tape, it is also perceived as weakening labour and environmental protections, causing a series of protests in major cities. Jokowi defended the law by saying that it would be needed to create jobs and called for protesters to lodge a challenge instead to the Constitutional Court of Indonesia.[152] The law, which revised over 70 previous laws and contained some 1,200 clauses, had been put forward by Jokowi following his 2019 re-election. Several groups had criticised the opaqueness of the government during the deliberation of the law.[153] In the same year, Indonesia hit the lowest inflation level in history[154] and faced the first economic recession since the 1997 Asian Financial crisis.[155]\nEarly in his first term, the opposition coalition within the DPR attempted to revoke a regulation (Perppu, Government Regulation in Lieu of Acts) issued by Jokowi's predecessor, which had guaranteed the holding of direct regional elections in Indonesia (and overrode a legislator-issued bill which arranged for indirect elections).[156] Jokowi supported the direct regional elections and opposed attempts to revoke the regulation, stating that \"direct regional elections was, in principle, non-negotiable\".[157] Within the first three years of his administration, Jokowi issued four such Perppu.[158]\nJudicial executions in Indonesia are carried out under a Presidential Decree following a death sentence imposed by a trial court.[159] Jokowi in 2015 said he would not grant clemency for drug offenders sentenced to death, arguing Indonesia was in a state of emergency over drug-related crimes, citing statistics the Jakarta Globe reported to be faulty.[160][161] His stance drew criticism as it could harm relations with the native countries of the condemned convicts,[162] and also imperil Indonesians facing the death penalty abroad.[163][164] Australia, Brazil and the Netherlands recalled their ambassadors from Indonesia following multiple executions in 2015.[15][165] Australia reduced its foreign aid to Indonesia by nearly half,[166] and Amnesty International issued a condemnation saying they showed a \"complete disregard for due process and human rights safeguards.\"[167] Former Indonesian Constitutional Court chief justice Jimly Asshiddiqie, who was a key player in the anti-death penalty lobby in Jakarta, said the push for the execution of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan had come from Jokowi personally.[168] The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Jokowi did not have or read related documents when he refused their clemency requests.[169] In the same year, Jokowi granted Frenchman Serge Atlaoui and Filipino Mary Jane Veloso temporary reprieves due to pending legal appeals.[169] As of 2017, around 260 people remain on death row in Indonesia.[170]\nRegarding terrorism, Jokowi's administration in early 2016 proposed replacing the 2003 anti-terrorism law. Following the 2018 Surabaya bombings, the worst terrorist attack on Indonesian soil since the 2002 Bali bombings, the controversial bill passed, allowing the Indonesian National Armed Forces to participate in counter-terrorism activities upon police request and presidential approval.[171] It also allowed extended detention of terror suspects and permitted wiretapping without initial court approval.[172] Jokowi had threatened to issue a presidential regulation in lieu of law (perppu) if the bill did not pass the parliament by June that year.[173]\nDuring Jokowi's administration, there have been numerous instances where people were arrested or reported to police for activities deemed insulting to the president.[174][175] Rights activists deem such arrests as a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech.[176][177] A group claiming to be Jokowi's supporters reported Tempo magazine to police over a caricature of Jokowi as Pinocchio,[178][179] after which the Presidential Palace issued a statement saying \"the President respected freedom of press and speech\".[180] A book about Jokowi titled Jokowi Undercover was banned upon release and its author sentenced to three years in prison[181] and buyers of the book being advised to surrender their copies to the authorities.[182] Tempo magazine described the 436-page book as \"trashy and tasteless, a compilation of hoax reports on President Joko Widodo, scattered across the internet and cyber chatrooms\".[183] The government's plans to resurrect a Dutch colonial law that would permit imprisonment for insulting the president resulted in widespread protests.[184][185] A Law Firm and Public Interest Law Office (AMAR) institution later reported following the protests that they received many complaints of students regarding threats and sanctions of expulsion or suspension from their schools and universities.[186] In addition, a remission granted to a journalist's murderer was revoked following media criticism.[187][188]\nIn response to major protests, Jokowi's administration has generated some controversies. On 22 May 2019, amid post-election riots by supporters of losing presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, the government limited the speed at which photos and videos could be shared on social media to stop people from being incited by fake news and calls for violence.[189][190] In the aftermath, Amnesty International's Indonesian office denounced repressive measures against the demonstrators, condemned them as a grave human rights abuse and demanded the government investigate the extrajudicial executions in the clashes.[191][192] In August and September 2019, the government blocked internet access in Papua and West Papua provinces amid violent protests against racism. Jakarta State Administrative Court in 2020 ruled the internet blocks in Papua illegal.[193]\nIn 2017, Jokowi supported a controversial bill on mass organisations, which upon passing resulted in the disbandment of the Indonesian branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir. He said the law was necessary to defend the national ideology, Pancasila.[194] The 2020 banning of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) was also based on that law.[195] Twenty-three days' earlier, police had shot dead six FPI members during a confrontation.[196][197] The president's subsequent defence of the police during their duty and his statement that no citizens should break the law or harm the country[198][199] was criticised by FPI Secretary-General Munarman as a justification of human rights abuse and structural violence.[200] A police chief involved in the car chase and subsequent murder claimed that the members were armed.[196] After the passing of several controversial bills and repressive crackdowns from security officers on major protests since 2019,[201] his presidency has been criticised for \"Neo-Authoritarianism\".[202][203][204][205] South China Morning Post even named him a 'Little Suharto'[2]\nA premium price hike of public health care BPJS Kesehatan through Executive Order (Perpres) 64/2020 was criticised as a flagrant breach of permanent Supreme Court (Mahkamah Agung) decision[206] that nullified the Perpres 82/2018 about the price hike. The Perpres 64/2020 itself was signed amid the COVID-19 pandemic that had caused hardship among the population.[207][208] His former Deputy Mayor of Surakarta, F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo, also voiced similar concerns.[209]\nJokowi's presidency coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Indonesian mass killings of 1965‚Äì66 in 2015. A government-supported symposium to resolve human rights violations surrounding the event was held in 2016, but Jokowi said his government would not apologise to the victims of the mass purge.[210][211] On LGBT rights, Jokowi stated that \"there should be no discrimination against anyone\", but added that \"in terms of our beliefs, [the LGBT lifestyle] isn't allowed, Islam does not allow it.\"[212] Under his presidency, the controversial transmigration program was cut once more, when in 2015, it was decided to end the migration program to the Papuan provinces.[213]\nBefore Jokowi's election, Indonesia's foreign policy under former President SBY was moulded by the mission statement, \"A thousand friends and zero enemies\".[214] Jokowi has mandated a three-pronged policy of maintaining Indonesia's sovereignty, enhancing the protection of Indonesian citizens, and intensifying economic diplomacy.[13]\nJokowi aspires Indonesia to become a global maritime power (Indonesian: poros maritim dunia or global maritime axis). He sees the sea would have an increasingly important role in Indonesia's future and that as a maritime country, Indonesia must assert itself as a force between the two oceans: the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The five pillars of this maritime-axis doctrine are rebuilding Indonesia's maritime culture, maintaining and managing marine resources, developing maritime infrastructure and connectivity as well as developing the shipping industry and maritime tourism, inviting other nations to cooperate in the marine field and eliminate the source of conflicts at sea, and developing maritime defence forces.[215] As part of this vision, Jokowi has adopted a tougher stance on illegal fishing.[216] He stated that Jakarta could no longer tolerate a situation where over 5,000 ships are operating illegally in its waters every day, making a mockery out of Indonesian sovereignty and resulting in annual losses of over $20 billion.[217][218]\nOn the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, particularly in the Natuna Islands where China's nine-dash line intercepts Indonesian EEZ claims, Jokowi stated that \"there will be no compromise on sovereignty\",[219] and renamed Indonesia's section of the waters in the South China Sea as \"North Natuna Sea\".[220] In June 2016, he held a cabinet meeting off the islands aboard the Indonesian Navy corvette KRI Imam Bonjol, calling to step up maritime patrols in the area.[221] Under his administration, Indonesia has released an \"Indo-Pacific Vision\" for ASEAN countries, which calls for regional architecture and considers the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a single interconnected geostrategic area.[222] Indonesia also entered a trilateral cooperation agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines, allowing coordinated patrols in the pirate-infested Sulu Sea.[223]\nIn the Muslim world, Jokowi released a statement calling for the Muslim leaders at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit meeting in Jakarta to unite in reconciliation and push for Palestinian independence.[224] Under Jokowi, Indonesia's Foreign Minister has visited Palestine but refused entreaties to establish bilateral diplomatic relations with Israel.[225] An honorary consul was established in Ramallah in the West Bank though it had to be inaugurated in Amman, Jordan.[226] Jokowi also condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and oversaw the departure of four Indonesian Air Force transport planes with 34 tons of relief supplies for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.[227][228]\nBy April 2019, it was made public that Jokowi had decided in a meeting with cabinet ministers to move the capital of Indonesia away from Jakarta to a location outside Java.[229] On 25 August 2019, it was further announced that the new capital would be located in Kalimantan, between the regencies of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara.[230]\nJokowi married his wife Iriana in 1986. The couple has two sons and one daughter. Their first son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka (born 1 October 1987), studied abroad in Sydney and Singapore (at the Management Development Institute of Singapore, MDIS) and currently runs a catering and wedding-planning business in Surakarta. Their only daughter, Kahiyang Ayu (born 20 April 1991), completed an undergraduate degree in food technology at the state-owned Sebelas Maret University in Surakarta. Their second son, Kaesang Pangarep (born 25 December 1994), completed his high school years in ACS International, Singapore,[231] and is an online vlogger. Jokowi has four grandchildren: a grandson and a granddaughter from Gibran (born in 2016 and 2019 respectively)[232] and a granddaughter and a grandson from Kahiyang (born in 2018 and 2020 respectively).[233]\nSeveral members of Jokowi's family have declared their intentions to enter politics by running as candidates in 2020 local elections. Gibran has declared his candidacy for the mayorship of Surakarta, in addition to his son-in-law Bobby Nasution (Medan) and brother-in-law Wahyu Purwanto (Gunung Kidul Regency).[234]\nJokowi has been described as \"Muslim but broadly secular in his outlook\".[235] His statement in 2019 that religion and politics should be separated prompted a public debate on whether he was promoting secularism in the country.[236] In June 2013, a film titled Jokowi, depicting Jokowi's childhood and youth, was released.[237] He expressed some objections to the film, saying that he felt his life had been a simple one and was not worthy of being adapted into a film.[238]\nAccording to The Economist, Jokowi \"has a penchant for loud rock music\" and owned a bass guitar signed by Robert Trujillo of heavy metal band Metallica which was confiscated by the KPK.[239] In November 2017, Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, who was on an official visit to Jakarta, gave Jokowi a Metallica Master of Puppets vinyl box set as a diplomatic gift. It was signed by the band's drummer and co-founder, Lars Ulrich, a Danish native.[240] Under his policy of transparency, Jokowi paid IDR 11 million ($800) out of his personal funds to claim the record, which had been declared a state asset to avoid accusations of gratification.[241]\n2008: Listed by Tempo as one of the 'Top 10 Indonesian Mayors of 2008'.[251]\n2012: Ranked 3rd at the 2012 World Mayor Prize for \"transforming a crime-ridden city into a regional centre for art and culture and an attractive city to tourists\".[252]\n2013: Listed as one of \"The Leading Global Thinkers of 2013\" in Foreign Policy magazine.

            "conversation": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Joko Widodo ]*\n\n\n\n\n\nJoko Widodo (Indonesian pronunciation:¬†[d í…îk…î wid…îd…î], born 21 June 1961), also known as Jokowi, is an Indonesian politician and businessman who is the 7th and current president of Indonesia. Elected in July 2014 as the first president not to come from an elite political or military background, he was previously the Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012 and the Governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014. Prior to his political career, he was an industrialist and businessman.[2][3]\nHe achieved national prominence in 2009 for his work as the Mayor of Surakarta. A member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), he was named as the party's candidate for the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election, alongside Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (often known as Ahok)[4] as his running mate.[5] Defeating incumbent Fauzi Bowo,[6] he took office in October 2012 and reinvigorated Jakartan politics, introducing publicised blusukan visits (unannounced spot checks)[7] and improving the city's bureaucracy, reducing corruption in the process. He also introduced years-late programs to improve quality of life, including universal healthcare, dredging the city's main river to reduce flooding, and inaugurating the construction of the city's subway system.[8]\nThe PDI-P nominated Jokowi, who was already seen as a rising star in Indonesian politics, for the 2014 presidential election.[9] Winning a majority of the popular vote, he was named president-elect on 22 July 2014, to bitter protest from his opponent Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome and withdrew from the race before the count was completed.[10][11] As president, Jokowi has primarily focused on infrastructure, introducing or restarting long-delayed programs to improve connectivity in the Indonesian archipelago.[12] On foreign policy, his administration has emphasised \"protecting Indonesia‚Äôs sovereignty\",[13] with the sinking of illegal foreign fishing vessels[14] and the prioritising and scheduling  of capital punishment for drug smugglers. The latter was despite intense representations and diplomatic protests from foreign powers, including Australia and France.[15][16] He was re-elected in 2019 for a second five-year term, again defeating Prabowo Subianto.[17]\nJoko Widodo was born Mulyono on 21 June 1961 in Surakarta[1] and is of Javanese descent.[18] He is the eldest of four siblings and is the only son of Noto Mihardjo (father) and Sudjiatmi Notomihardjo (mother). He has three younger sisters, named Iit Sriyantini, Ida Yati, and Titik Relawati.[19][20] His father came from Karanganyar, while his grandparents came from a village in Boyolali.[21] Jokowi was often sick as a toddler, and his name was thus changed‚Äîa common practice in Javanese culture‚Äîto Joko Widodo, with widodo meaning \"healthy\" in Javanese.[18] At the age of 12, he started working in his father's furniture workshop.[22][23] Throughout his childhood, Jokowi's family constantly faced evictions from their landlords; this greatly affected him, and later in his career, he organised medical housing in Surakarta during his years as mayor of the city.[24]\nJokowi's education began at State Elementary School 111 Tirtoyoso, known for being a school for less wealthy citizens.[25] He continued his studies in State Junior High School 1 Surakarta,[26] and later wanted to attend State Senior High School 1 Surakarta, but failed the entrance exam and instead enrolled in State Senior High School 6 Surakarta.[27] Jokowi graduated from the Forestry faculty at Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, in 1985, where his work included studies and research on the use of plywood. He later began work at PT Kertas Kraft Aceh (id), a state-owned firm in Aceh, Sumatra.[28] He worked in the present-day Bener Meriah Regency between 1986 and 1988 as a supervisor of forestry and raw materials of a Pinus merkusii plantation.[29][30]\nJokowi, however, soon became uninterested in his activities in the firm and returned home. He began working in his grandfather's furniture factory for a year before establishing his own company, Rakabu, whose namesake is his first child. The company, which mainly focused on teak furniture, nearly went bankrupt at one point but survived following an IDR 500 million loan from Perusahaan Gas Negara. By 1991, the company began exporting its products, and they were successful in international markets. The firm first established a presence in the European market in France, and it was a French customer named Bernard who gave Joko Widodo the nickname \"Jokowi\".[28][31][3]\nBy 2002, Jokowi had become the chairman of Surakarta's furniture manufacturers association.[3] Ultimately he decided to become a politician and promote reform in his home town, Surakarta, after seeing the neat layouts of some European cities while promoting his furniture there.[23] After becoming mayor, he also made a joint venture with politician and former lieutenant general Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, when the two founded PT Rakabu Sejahtera (from Rakabu and Luhut's PT Toba Sejahtera).[32][33]\nJokowi reported his net worth in 2018 to be Rp 50.25 billion (US$3.5 million), mostly in the form of property holdings in Central Java and Jakarta.[34]\nAfter first joining PDI-P in 2004, Jokowi ran in the mayoral race in Surakarta in 2005 with F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo as his running mate, with the support of PDI-P and the National Awakening Party.[35][36] The pair won 36.62% of the vote against the incumbent Slamet Suryanto and two other candidates. During the campaign, many questioned his background as a property and furniture businessman. However, one academic paper claimed his leadership style was successful because it established an interactive relationship with the people, through which he was able to induce people's strong faith in him.[37] He adopted the development framework of European cities (which he frequently travelled to as a businessman) as a guide for changes in Surakarta.[38]\nHis notable policies as mayor included:[39] Building new traditional markets and renovating existing markets, constructing a 7-km city walk with a 3-meter wide pedestrian walkway along Surakarta's main street, revitalising the Balekambang and Sriwedari parks, employing stricter regulations on cutting down trees along the city's main streets, rebranding the city as a centre of Javanese culture and tourism under the tagline 'The Spirit of Java', promoting the city as a centre for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE), launching healthcare and education insurance program for all residents, a local bus rapid transit system named Batik Solo Trans and a Solo Techno Park, which helped support the Esemka Indonesian car project.[40] It was during his tenure as mayor that he conducted the blusukan, an impromptu visit to specific areas to listen to people's issues, which proved popular later in his political career. He also prohibited his family members from bidding for city projects, therefore suppressing the risk of corruption. His policies brought him into conflict with then provincial governor Bibit Waluyo, who on one occasion called Jokowi a \"fool\" for the latter's opposition to a provincial construction project in Surakarta.[41]\nHis supporters pointed to rapid positive changes in Surakarta under his leadership and the city's branding with the motto 'Solo: The Spirit of Java'. While in office, he successfully relocated antique stalls in the Banjarsari Gardens without incident, a helpful move in revitalising the functions of the open green land; he emphasised the importance of business firms engaging in community activities; he improved communications with the local community by appearing regularly on local television. As a follow-up of the city's new branding, he applied for Surakarta to become a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities, which was approved in 2006, and subsequently had the city chosen to host the organisation's conference in October 2008. In 2007, Surakarta had also hosted the World Music Festival (Festival Musik Dunia/FMD), held at the complex of Fort Vastenburg near the centre of the city. The following year, it was held in the Mangkunegaran Palace Complex.\nPart of Jokowi's style was his populist 'can-do' (punya gaye) elements designed to build bonds with the broad electorate.[37] As mayor, he became personally involved in an incident just before Christmas 2011 when the Surakarta municipality had overdue bills of close to $1 million (IDR 8.9 billion) owed to the state-owned electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). Following its policy of pursuing a more disciplined approach to collecting overdue bills, it imposed a blackout on street lights in the city just before Christmas. The city government quickly authorised payment, but in settling the bill, protested that the PLN should consider the public interest before taking such action. To reinforce the point, Jokowi made a highly publicised personal visit to the local PLN office to deliver the IDR 8.9 billion in cash in the form of hundreds of bundles of notes and even small coins.[42]\nIn 2010, he was re-elected for a second term, again running with Hadi. They won 90.09% of the vote, losing in only a single polling station.[43] He was later chosen as the 'Tempo Leader of Choice' by Tempo news magazine (2008) and received a 'Changemakers Award' from Republika newspaper (2010); his name also started being considered in national polls for the governorship of Jakarta, long before PDI-P's nomination, including those by University of Indonesia and Cyrus Network (2011).[37]\nIn 2012, Jokowi faced a smear campaign after declaring his intention to run for the governorship of Jakarta.[44] A group calling itself Save Solo, Save Jakarta and Save Indonesia Team (TS3) reported him to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) for allegedly having facilitated misuse of education funds by his subordinates in Surakarta in 2010. The KPK investigated the allegation, found it was based on false data and said there was no indication Jokowi had misappropriated funds.[45]\nDespite disappointment from some Surakarta residents that he would not complete his second term as mayor,[46] Jokowi ran in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election and defeated the incumbent Fauzi Bowo in a runoff round.[6] His inner circle of advisers in Jakarta reportedly included people such as FX Hadi 'Rudy' Rudyatmo, Sumartono Hadinoto and Anggit Nugroho, who were colleagues while he was mayor of Surakarta, as well as Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (\"Ahok\"), his deputy as governor of Jakarta.[47][48] Jokowi continued the blusukan practice he had adopted as mayor of Surakarta by regularly visiting population centers, especially slums. During these visits, he wore simple, informal clothes and stopped at markets or walked along narrow Jakarta alleys to listen and witness firsthand issues addressed by residents, such as the price of food, housing difficulties, flooding, and transportation. Polling and media coverage suggested that his hands-on style proved very popular both in Jakarta and elsewhere across Indonesia.[49]\nAfter taking office, taxes and Jakarta's provincial budget increased significantly from IDR 41 trillion in 2012 to IDR 72 trillion in 2014.[50][51] Both Jokowi and Ahok publicised their monthly salary and the provincial budget.[52][53] They also initiated programs aimed towards transparency, such as online taxes, e-budgeting, e-purchasing, and a cash management system.[52] Moreover, all meetings and activities that Jokowi and Ahok attended were recorded and uploaded on YouTube.[54]\nIn healthcare, Jokowi introduced a universal health care program, the 'Healthy Jakarta Card' (Kartu Jakarta Sehat, KJS).[55] It involved an insurance program provided through state-owned insurance company PT Askes Indonesia (Persero) and a plan to regulate health charges for treatment for over 20,000 services and procedures.[56] The program was criticised for confusion over details of the implementation and long queues,[57] though Jokowi defended it and counselled patience. In education, Jokowi launched the 'Smart Jakarta Card' (Kartu Jakarta Pintar, KJP) on 1 December 2012 to help needy students. It gives an allowance that can be withdrawn from ATMs for buying school needs such as books and uniforms.[58]\nHis administration's other notable policies include a system of bureaucratic recruitment called lelang jabatan (literally 'auction of office position'), giving every civil servant the same opportunity to achieve a certain position by fulfilling the required qualifications,[59] regulation of the chaotic agglomeration of street vendors in Pasar Minggu and Pasar Tanah Abang,[60][61] the dredging and reservoir normalisation projects to reduce flooding,[62][63][64] and the inauguration of long-delayed Jakarta MRT and Jakarta LRT.[65][66] As governor, Jokowi also appointed a non-Muslim 'lurah' (subdistrict chief) for the Muslim-majority subdistrict of Lenteng Agung despite protests by some residents.[67] Former deputy governor Prijanto claimed that Widodo had carried out maladministration when abusing government certificate asset of BMW Park by formalising another expired certificate.[68]\nIn 2013, Jokowi was reported to the National Commission on Human Rights over the eviction of the squatters near Pluit. In previous \"political contracts\", he had vowed not to evict residents to distant locations.[69][70] Jokowi met with Pluit residents and Komnas HAM to explain the evictions were necessary for restoring water catchment to reduce flooding and that families were being relocated to low-cost apartments.[71][72]\nMegawati Sukarnoputri nominated Jokowi to be the presidential candidate of her party.[9] During the campaign, a social media volunteer team, JASMEV, once made a provocative statement by threatening that Islam would not be given a space in Indonesia if Jokowi won the 2014 election.[73][74] The group was paid IDR 500 million to campaign for the Jokowi-Jusuf Kalla ticket during the 2014 election.[75]\nFollowing the release of Quick Count results from many different polls, Jokowi declared victory on 9 July. However, his opponent Prabowo Subianto also declared victory, creating confusion among the population.[76] On 22 July, hours before the announcement of the election results, Prabowo withdrew.[77] Jokowi's victory was expected and realised hours later.[78][77] The General Elections Commission (KPU) gave him a close victory with 53.15% of the vote (almost 71 million votes), to Prabowo's 46.85% (62 million votes),[79] though Prabowo's camp disputed these totals.[80]\nAfter his victory, Jokowi stated that growing up under the authoritarian and corrupt New Order regime, he would have never expected someone with a lower-class background to become president. The New York Times reported him as saying, \"now, it's quite similar to America, yeah? There is the American dream, and here we have the Indonesian dream\".[81] Jokowi was the first Indonesian president outside the military or the political elite, and the political commentator Salim Said gave the popular view of the politician as \"someone who is our neighbour, who decided to get into politics and run for president.\"[81]\nIn 2018, Jokowi announced that he would run for re-election next year. His vice president Jusuf Kalla was not eligible for another term because of the term limits set for president and vice president. Kalla had already served a five-year term as vice president during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's first term (2004-2009). Speculation surrounding Jokowi's choice of running mate focused on several candidates, including Mahfud MD, a former defence minister and chief justice of the Constitutional Court. In a surprise move, Jokowi announced that Ma'ruf Amin would be his running mate. Mahfud had reportedly been preparing for the vice-presidential candidacy. Ma'ruf was selected instead following a push by several constituent parties of Jokowi's governing coalition and influential Islamic figures.[82] Explaining his decision, Jokowi referred to Ma'ruf's extensive experience in government and religious affairs.[83]\nThe KPU officially announced that the Jokowi-Amin ticket had won the election in the early hours of 21 May 2019.[84] The official vote tally was 85 million votes for Jokowi (55.50%) and 68 million votes for Prabowo (44.50%).[85] Supporters of Prabowo protested in Jakarta against the result, and it turned into a riot which left eight people dead and over 600 injured.[86] Following the protests, Prabowo's campaign team launched a Constitutional Court lawsuit but was rejected in its entirety.[87]\nDespite vowing not to give government positions simply to political allies during the 2014 campaign, many members of political parties received ministerial positions in Jokowi's first cabinet.[88][89] The first year of Jokowi's administration saw him controlling a minority government until Golkar, the second-largest party in the People's Representative Council (DPR), switched from opposition to the government. Jokowi denied accusations of interfering with Golkar's internal affairs, although he admitted that Luhut might have influenced the change.[90] His cabinet's Minister of Industry Airlangga Hartarto was elected chairman of Golkar in 2018.[91] The National Mandate Party (PAN) had also switched sides beforehand but later returned to being the opposition in 2018.[92][93]\nJokowi announced the 34 names in his cabinet on 26 October 2014.[94] While it was praised for the inclusiveness of women, with Retno Marsudi becoming Indonesia's first female foreign minister, it received criticism for several perceived political inclusions, such as Puan Maharani (daughter of Megawati Sukarnoputri).[95] The Jokowi administration also saw the formation of two new ministries (Ministry of Public Works and Housing and Ministry of Environment and Forestry) from a merger of old ministries, in addition to renaming and reorganisation of other ministries.[96] He conducted a total of three cabinet reshuffles until 2018, removing ministers such as Rizal Ramli and Bambang Brodjonegoro while including ministers such as Luhut and World Bank Director Sri Mulyani Indrawati.[97] Another reshuffle occurred in December 2020, replacing six ministers including two apprehended by the KPK.[98]\nHe was criticised by PDI-P over perceived policy weaknesses, and PDI-P legislator Effendi Simbolon called for his impeachment.[99] On 9 April 2015, during a PDI-P Congress, party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri referred to Jokowi as a functionary. She noted that presidential candidates are nominated by political parties, hinting that Jokowi owed his position to the party and should carry out its policy line.[100][101] Several months prior, Megawati and Jokowi had disputed over the appointment of a new police chief, with Megawati supporting her former adjutant Budi Gunawan while Jokowi supported Badrodin Haiti.[90][102][103]\nFollowing his re-election, Jokowi announced his second cabinet on 23 October 2019. He retained several ministers such as Sri Mulyani and Luhut but also included Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim and two-time presidential rival Prabowo Subianto as education and defence ministers, respectively.[104]\nIn the first year of his second presidential term, his approval rating fell to 45.2%, and the disapproval rating was 52%.[105][106] His deputy, Ma'ruf Amin, had a 67% disapproval rating. The low ratings were attributed to unpopular policies.\nBefore taking office, Jokowi sought for outgoing President SBY to take responsibility for the decision to further increase fuel prices[107] by further removing subsidies.[108] Previous attempts by SBY to do so had resulted in civil unrest.[107] On 1 January 2015, Jokowi took measures that, on the surface, appeared to reduce fuel subsidies.[109][110] The policy stirred up some demonstrations, with Jokowi citing it as necessary to increase funding for the infrastructure, education and health sectors.[111] However, since March 2015, the government has set the price of Premium-branded gasoline far below the market price, causing the fuel subsidy to be incurred by state-owned oil company Pertamina instead of the direct government account.[112] Additionally, the government also implemented a single-price program, aiming to sell fuel through official channels at the same price nationally, including in isolated parts of Kalimantan and Papua. The government claimed that this was achieved in 2017.[113]\nIn the first quarter of 2015, year-on-year GDP grew 4.92%, and in the second quarter, it grew 4.6%, the lowest figure since 2009.[114][115][116] Since then, growth has remained above the 5% mark, which is still below what is considered a healthy economic growth mark of 6%.[117] The Indonesian rupiah (IDR) has also weakened throughout Jokowi's administration, with its exchange rate per US dollar briefly passing IDR 15,000 in 2018, the lowest level since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and sank lower to 16,700 in 2020.[118][119] The year-on-year inflation in June 2015 was 7.26%, higher than in May (7.15%) and June the year before (6.7%).[120]\nJokowi's administration continued the resource nationalism policy of its predecessor, nationalising some assets controlled by multinational companies such as Freeport McMoRan, Total SA and Chevron. In 2018, in a move aimed to cut imports, oil companies operating in Indonesia were ordered to sell their crude oil to state-owned Pertamina.[121] A ban was also enforced on the exports of raw nickel ore, intended to help promote the development of local nickel-related industries such as smelters and battery factories.[122]\nInfrastructure development has been a significant feature of the Jokowi administration, focusing on road and railway expansion, seaports and airports development, and irrigation. In 2016, the state budget allocated Rp 290 trillion (US$22 billion) for infrastructure, the biggest in Indonesian history.[123] In total, his administration planned 265 infrastructure projects starting in 2016.[124] In September 2015, Indonesia awarded a $5.5 billion high-speed rail project to China,[125][126] to Japan's disappointment, which is also vying for the project.[127] Indonesia's transportation ministry laid out a litany of shortcomings in plans for the project, casting doubt on the project and spotlighting Jokowi's limits in turning mega-projects into reality as he tries to draw foreign investors.[128] Other significant projects include the completion of the 4,325-kilometer Trans Papua road and the Trans-Java Toll Road,[129][130] initial construction of the Trans-Sulawesi Railway[131] and the Trans-Sumatra Toll Road,[132] a US$50 billion plan to develop the maritime sector including 24 \"strategic ports\",[133] and expansion of airport capacity in remote areas.[134] The ports' development and modernisation program, dubbed the \"Sea Toll Road\" program, was aimed to reduce price inequality between the better developed western parts of the country and the less populated eastern parts.[135]\nIn addition to the major projects, the Jokowi administration also implemented a village fund program in which villages across the country received funding to allocate on basic infrastructures such as roads and water supply, tourism development and village enterprises to improve rural economies.[136][137] The initial campaign promise was that IDR 1.4 billion (around US$100,000) would be allocated for every village annually,[138] though as of 2019, less than a billion was allocated.[139] Between 2015 and 2018, IDR 187 trillion (US$14 billion) had been reallocated through the program.[140] The administration has targeted to streamline land certification across the country, aiming to distribute certificates of land ownership across the country completely. It involved increasing the issuing rate of certificates from around 500,000 to several million annually.[141][142] In 2016, the administration signed into law a tax amnesty bill following a lengthy public debate and push back, giving wealthy Indonesians a chance to declare their unreported assets before the government would strengthen rules and oversight around imports and exports. It became the most successful program of its kind in history, with over IDR 4,865 trillion (approximately US$366 billion) of previously unreported assets declared to the tax office.[143][144]\nThe opposition criticised the aggressive spending on infrastructure as it increased Indonesia's national debt by 48% between 2014 and March 2018 to US$181 billion. They also pointed out that most of the debt was allocated for remunerations rather than infrastructure development.[145][146][147] In April 2018, Jokowi also issued a new policy that allows foreign workers in Indonesia without Indonesian language skills requirement,[148] reasoning that it would increase investments.[149] The policy faced significant opposition from local labour unions, who claimed that the policy would increase unemployment rates.[150][151]\nIn 2020, the DPR passed the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. Though intended to boost investment and reduce red tape, it is also perceived as weakening labour and environmental protections, causing a series of protests in major cities. Jokowi defended the law by saying that it would be needed to create jobs and called for protesters to lodge a challenge instead to the Constitutional Court of Indonesia.[152] The law, which revised over 70 previous laws and contained some 1,200 clauses, had been put forward by Jokowi following his 2019 re-election. Several groups had criticised the opaqueness of the government during the deliberation of the law.[153] In the same year, Indonesia hit the lowest inflation level in history[154] and faced the first economic recession since the 1997 Asian Financial crisis.[155]\nEarly in his first term, the opposition coalition within the DPR attempted to revoke a regulation (Perppu, Government Regulation in Lieu of Acts) issued by Jokowi's predecessor, which had guaranteed the holding of direct regional elections in Indonesia (and overrode a legislator-issued bill which arranged for indirect elections).[156] Jokowi supported the direct regional elections and opposed attempts to revoke the regulation, stating that \"direct regional elections was, in principle, non-negotiable\".[157] Within the first three years of his administration, Jokowi issued four such Perppu.[158]\nJudicial executions in Indonesia are carried out under a Presidential Decree following a death sentence imposed by a trial court.[159] Jokowi in 2015 said he would not grant clemency for drug offenders sentenced to death, arguing Indonesia was in a state of emergency over drug-related crimes, citing statistics the Jakarta Globe reported to be faulty.[160][161] His stance drew criticism as it could harm relations with the native countries of the condemned convicts,[162] and also imperil Indonesians facing the death penalty abroad.[163][164] Australia, Brazil and the Netherlands recalled their ambassadors from Indonesia following multiple executions in 2015.[15][165] Australia reduced its foreign aid to Indonesia by nearly half,[166] and Amnesty International issued a condemnation saying they showed a \"complete disregard for due process and human rights safeguards.\"[167] Former Indonesian Constitutional Court chief justice Jimly Asshiddiqie, who was a key player in the anti-death penalty lobby in Jakarta, said the push for the execution of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan had come from Jokowi personally.[168] The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Jokowi did not have or read related documents when he refused their clemency requests.[169] In the same year, Jokowi granted Frenchman Serge Atlaoui and Filipino Mary Jane Veloso temporary reprieves due to pending legal appeals.[169] As of 2017, around 260 people remain on death row in Indonesia.[170]\nRegarding terrorism, Jokowi's administration in early 2016 proposed replacing the 2003 anti-terrorism law. Following the 2018 Surabaya bombings, the worst terrorist attack on Indonesian soil since the 2002 Bali bombings, the controversial bill passed, allowing the Indonesian National Armed Forces to participate in counter-terrorism activities upon police request and presidential approval.[171] It also allowed extended detention of terror suspects and permitted wiretapping without initial court approval.[172] Jokowi had threatened to issue a presidential regulation in lieu of law (perppu) if the bill did not pass the parliament by June that year.[173]\nDuring Jokowi's administration, there have been numerous instances where people were arrested or reported to police for activities deemed insulting to the president.[174][175] Rights activists deem such arrests as a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech.[176][177] A group claiming to be Jokowi's supporters reported Tempo magazine to police over a caricature of Jokowi as Pinocchio,[178][179] after which the Presidential Palace issued a statement saying \"the President respected freedom of press and speech\".[180] A book about Jokowi titled Jokowi Undercover was banned upon release and its author sentenced to three years in prison[181] and buyers of the book being advised to surrender their copies to the authorities.[182] Tempo magazine described the 436-page book as \"trashy and tasteless, a compilation of hoax reports on President Joko Widodo, scattered across the internet and cyber chatrooms\".[183] The government's plans to resurrect a Dutch colonial law that would permit imprisonment for insulting the president resulted in widespread protests.[184][185] A Law Firm and Public Interest Law Office (AMAR) institution later reported following the protests that they received many complaints of students regarding threats and sanctions of expulsion or suspension from their schools and universities.[186] In addition, a remission granted to a journalist's murderer was revoked following media criticism.[187][188]\nIn response to major protests, Jokowi's administration has generated some controversies. On 22 May 2019, amid post-election riots by supporters of losing presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, the government limited the speed at which photos and videos could be shared on social media to stop people from being incited by fake news and calls for violence.[189][190] In the aftermath, Amnesty International's Indonesian office denounced repressive measures against the demonstrators, condemned them as a grave human rights abuse and demanded the government investigate the extrajudicial executions in the clashes.[191][192] In August and September 2019, the government blocked internet access in Papua and West Papua provinces amid violent protests against racism. Jakarta State Administrative Court in 2020 ruled the internet blocks in Papua illegal.[193]\nIn 2017, Jokowi supported a controversial bill on mass organisations, which upon passing resulted in the disbandment of the Indonesian branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir. He said the law was necessary to defend the national ideology, Pancasila.[194] The 2020 banning of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) was also based on that law.[195] Twenty-three days' earlier, police had shot dead six FPI members during a confrontation.[196][197] The president's subsequent defence of the police during their duty and his statement that no citizens should break the law or harm the country[198][199] was criticised by FPI Secretary-General Munarman as a justification of human rights abuse and structural violence.[200] A police chief involved in the car chase and subsequent murder claimed that the members were armed.[196] After the passing of several controversial bills and repressive crackdowns from security officers on major protests since 2019,[201] his presidency has been criticised for \"Neo-Authoritarianism\".[202][203][204][205] South China Morning Post even named him a 'Little Suharto'[2]\nA premium price hike of public health care BPJS Kesehatan through Executive Order (Perpres) 64/2020 was criticised as a flagrant breach of permanent Supreme Court (Mahkamah Agung) decision[206] that nullified the Perpres 82/2018 about the price hike. The Perpres 64/2020 itself was signed amid the COVID-19 pandemic that had caused hardship among the population.[207][208] His former Deputy Mayor of Surakarta, F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo, also voiced similar concerns.[209]\nJokowi's presidency coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Indonesian mass killings of 1965‚Äì66 in 2015. A government-supported symposium to resolve human rights violations surrounding the event was held in 2016, but Jokowi said his government would not apologise to the victims of the mass purge.[210][211] On LGBT rights, Jokowi stated that \"there should be no discrimination against anyone\", but added that \"in terms of our beliefs, [the LGBT lifestyle] isn't allowed, Islam does not allow it.\"[212] Under his presidency, the controversial transmigration program was cut once more, when in 2015, it was decided to end the migration program to the Papuan provinces.[213]\nBefore Jokowi's election, Indonesia's foreign policy under former President SBY was moulded by the mission statement, \"A thousand friends and zero enemies\".[214] Jokowi has mandated a three-pronged policy of maintaining Indonesia's sovereignty, enhancing the protection of Indonesian citizens, and intensifying economic diplomacy.[13]\nJokowi aspires Indonesia to become a global maritime power (Indonesian: poros maritim dunia or global maritime axis). He sees the sea would have an increasingly important role in Indonesia's future and that as a maritime country, Indonesia must assert itself as a force between the two oceans: the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The five pillars of this maritime-axis doctrine are rebuilding Indonesia's maritime culture, maintaining and managing marine resources, developing maritime infrastructure and connectivity as well as developing the shipping industry and maritime tourism, inviting other nations to cooperate in the marine field and eliminate the source of conflicts at sea, and developing maritime defence forces.[215] As part of this vision, Jokowi has adopted a tougher stance on illegal fishing.[216] He stated that Jakarta could no longer tolerate a situation where over 5,000 ships are operating illegally in its waters every day, making a mockery out of Indonesian sovereignty and resulting in annual losses of over $20 billion.[217][218]\nOn the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, particularly in the Natuna Islands where China's nine-dash line intercepts Indonesian EEZ claims, Jokowi stated that \"there will be no compromise on sovereignty\",[219] and renamed Indonesia's section of the waters in the South China Sea as \"North Natuna Sea\".[220] In June 2016, he held a cabinet meeting off the islands aboard the Indonesian Navy corvette KRI Imam Bonjol, calling to step up maritime patrols in the area.[221] Under his administration, Indonesia has released an \"Indo-Pacific Vision\" for ASEAN countries, which calls for regional architecture and considers the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a single interconnected geostrategic area.[222] Indonesia also entered a trilateral cooperation agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines, allowing coordinated patrols in the pirate-infested Sulu Sea.[223]\nIn the Muslim world, Jokowi released a statement calling for the Muslim leaders at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit meeting in Jakarta to unite in reconciliation and push for Palestinian independence.[224] Under Jokowi, Indonesia's Foreign Minister has visited Palestine but refused entreaties to establish bilateral diplomatic relations with Israel.[225] An honorary consul was established in Ramallah in the West Bank though it had to be inaugurated in Amman, Jordan.[226] Jokowi also condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and oversaw the departure of four Indonesian Air Force transport planes with 34 tons of relief supplies for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.[227][228]\nBy April 2019, it was made public that Jokowi had decided in a meeting with cabinet ministers to move the capital of Indonesia away from Jakarta to a location outside Java.[229] On 25 August 2019, it was further announced that the new capital would be located in Kalimantan, between the regencies of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara.[230]\nJokowi married his wife Iriana in 1986. The couple has two sons and one daughter. Their first son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka (born 1 October 1987), studied abroad in Sydney and Singapore (at the Management Development Institute of Singapore, MDIS) and currently runs a catering and wedding-planning business in Surakarta. Their only daughter, Kahiyang Ayu (born 20 April 1991), completed an undergraduate degree in food technology at the state-owned Sebelas Maret University in Surakarta. Their second son, Kaesang Pangarep (born 25 December 1994), completed his high school years in ACS International, Singapore,[231] and is an online vlogger. Jokowi has four grandchildren: a grandson and a granddaughter from Gibran (born in 2016 and 2019 respectively)[232] and a granddaughter and a grandson from Kahiyang (born in 2018 and 2020 respectively).[233]\nSeveral members of Jokowi's family have declared their intentions to enter politics by running as candidates in 2020 local elections. Gibran has declared his candidacy for the mayorship of Surakarta, in addition to his son-in-law Bobby Nasution (Medan) and brother-in-law Wahyu Purwanto (Gunung Kidul Regency).[234]\nJokowi has been described as \"Muslim but broadly secular in his outlook\".[235] His statement in 2019 that religion and politics should be separated prompted a public debate on whether he was promoting secularism in the country.[236] In June 2013, a film titled Jokowi, depicting Jokowi's childhood and youth, was released.[237] He expressed some objections to the film, saying that he felt his life had been a simple one and was not worthy of being adapted into a film.[238]\nAccording to The Economist, Jokowi \"has a penchant for loud rock music\" and owned a bass guitar signed by Robert Trujillo of heavy metal band Metallica which was confiscated by the KPK.[239] In November 2017, Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke Rasmussen, who was on an official visit to Jakarta, gave Jokowi a Metallica Master of Puppets vinyl box set as a diplomatic gift. It was signed by the band's drummer and co-founder, Lars Ulrich, a Danish native.[240] Under his policy of transparency, Jokowi paid IDR 11 million ($800) out of his personal funds to claim the record, which had been declared a state asset to avoid accusations of gratification.[241]\n2008: Listed by Tempo as one of the 'Top 10 Indonesian Mayors of 2008'.[251]\n2012: Ranked 3rd at the 2012 World Mayor Prize for \"transforming a crime-ridden city into a regional centre for art and culture and an attractive city to tourists\".[252]\n2013: Listed as one of \"The Leading Global Thinkers of 2013\" in Foreign Policy magazine. In February 2013, he was nominated as the global mayor of the month by the City Mayors Foundation, based in London.[253]\n2014: Listed by Fortune as one of \"The World's 50 Greatest Leaders\".[254]\n2016‚Äì2017: List by \"The Muslim 500\" as one of the most influential Muslims in the world, which ranked 11 in 2016 and 13 in 2017.[255][256]\n2020: Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan renamed a street in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates after him.[257]\n"

        "text": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Makkah ]*\n\nMakkah[a], secara resmi bernama Makkah al-Mukarramah (bahasa Arab: ŸÖŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÉÿ±ŸÖÿ©, translit.¬†Makkat al-Mukarramah, har.¬†'Makkah, Kota yang Mulia'‚Äé), adalah salah satu kota suci Islam dan ibukota Provinsi Makkah, Arab Saudi.[2] Kota ini terletak 70¬†km (43¬†mi) ke daratan dari Jeddah di Laut Merah, di sebuah lembah kecil 277¬†m (909¬†ft) di atas permukaan laut. Populasi terakhir yang tercatat berjumlah 1.578.722 jiwa pada tahun 2015.[3] Diperkirakan populasi metro pada tahun 2020 adalah 2,042 juta jiwa, membuat Makkah sebagai kota terpadat ketiga di kerajaan. Peziarah yang berdatangan berjumlah tiga kali lipat dari penduduk setempat selama ibadah Haji setiap bulan Zulhijah.\nMakkah merupakan tempat lahir dari Muhammad. Gua Hira yang terletak di atas Jabal an-Nur berada di luar kota Makkah dan gua tersebut merupakan lokasi yang umat Islam percaya bahwa al-Qur'an pertama kali diturunkan kepada Muhammad.[4][5] Mengunjungi Makkah untuk ibadah Haji merupakan kewajiban bagi umat Islam yang mampu. Masjidil Haram merupakan rumah bagi Ka'bah‚Äîdiyakini oleh umat Islam telah dibangun oleh Ibrahim dan Isma'il‚Äîyang merupakan salah satu situs suci Islam dan patokan arah salat bagi umat Islam (kiblat), yang memperkuat makna kota Makkah bagi umat Islam.[6]\nPara penguasa Muslim, baik dari dalam maupun dari sekitar wilayah tersebut telah lama mencoba untuk merebut kota Makkah dan mempertahankan kota tersebut dalam kekuasaannya. Dengan demikian, seperti halnya kebanyakan wilayah Hijaz, kota tersebut mengalami berbagai perubahan rezim yang berutang pada sejarahnya yang kaya. Kota ini akhirnya ditaklukan dalam penaklukan Hijaz oleh Saudi yang dipimpin oleh Ibnu Saud dan sekutunya pada tahun 1925. Sejak itu, Makkah terlihat ekspansi yang luar biasa dalam ukuran dan infrastruktur dengan bangunan modern yang lebih baru seperti Menara Abraj Al Bait, bangunan tertinggi keempat di dunia dan terbesar ketiga berdasarkan luas lantai yang menjulang tinggi di atas Masjidil Haram. Pemerintah Saudi juga melakukan penghancuran beberapa bangunan bersejarah dan situs arkeologi, seperti Benteng Ajyad.[7][8][9] Kalangan non-Muslim sangat dilarang untuk memasuki kota Makkah.[10][11]\nUmat Islam dari seluruh dunia mengunjungi kota Makkah, tidak hanya untuk ibadah Haji dan Umrah, tetapi juga sebagai turis untuk mengunjungi landmark wilayah tersebut, seperti Masjid Aisyah dan situs yang dikunjungi oleh jamaah Haji dan Umrah. Makkah sekarang menjadi rumah bagi dua bangunan termahal di dunia, Masjidil Haram yang senilai 100 miliar dolar AS dan kompleks Menara Abraj Al Bait yang senilai 15 miliar dolar AS.\nKota Makkah terletak sekitar 600¬†km sebelah selatan kota Madinah, kurang lebih 200¬†km sebelah timur laut kota Jeddah. Kota ini merupakan lembah sempit yang dikelilingi gunung-gunung dengan bangunan Ka'bah sebagai pusatnya. Dengan demikian, pada masa dahulu kota ini rawan banjir bila di musim hujan sebelum akhirnya pemerintah Arab Saudi memperbaiki kota ini dan merenovasi kota ini. Seperti pada umumnya kota-kota di wilayah Arab Saudi, kota ini beriklim gurun.\nPerkembangan kota Makkah tidak terlepas dari keberadaan Nabi Ismail dan Hajar sebagai penduduk pertama kota ini yang ditempatkan oleh Nabi Ibrahim atas perintah Allah.[14] Pada perkembangannya muncul orang orang Jurhum yang akhirnya tinggal di sana. Pada masa berikutnya kota ini dipimpin oleh Quraisy yang merupakan kabilah atau suku yang utama di Jazirah Arab karena memiliki hak pemeliharaan terhadap Ka'bah. Suku ini terkenal dalam bidang perdagangan bahkan pada masa itu aktivitas dagang mereka dikenal hingga Damaskus, Palestina, dan Afrika. Tokoh sebagai kepala kabilah Quraisy adalah Qussai yang dilanjutkan oleh Abdul Muthalib.\nPada tahun 571, Nabi Muhammad keturunan langsung dari Nabi Ismail serta Qussai, lahir di kota ini dan tumbuh dewasa. Pertama kali menerima wahyu dari Allah namun ajarannya ditolak kaumnya yang saat itu masih berada dalam kegelapan pemikiran (Jahiliah) sehingga berpindah ke Madinah. Setelah Madinah berkembang, akhirnya Nabi Muhammad kembali ke Makkah dalam misi membebaskan kota Makkah tanpa pertumpahan darah yang dikenal dengan (Fathul Makkah).\nPada masa selanjutnya Makkah berada di bawah administrasi Khulafaur Rasyidin yang berpusat di Madinah, serta para Khalifah yang saat itu berkuasa di Damaskus (Dinasti Ummayyah), Bagdad (Dinasti Abbasiyah), dan Istanbul (Usmaniah). Kemudian setelah hancurnya sistem kekhalifahan, kota ini dikuasai oleh Syarif Makkah yang ikut melawan pemerintah Usmaniah dan tak selang beberapa lama berhasil direbut dan disatukan dalam pemerintahan Arab Saudi oleh Abdul Aziz bin Saud yang kemudian menjadi pelayan bagi kedua kota suci Islam, Makkah dan Madinah. Gelar yang biasa disandang para penguasa yang pernah memimpin dua kota suci tersebut.\n\nSistem administrasi pemerintahan Kota Makkah, dipimpin oleh seorang wali kota (disebut amir) yang ditunjuk oleh Pemerintah Arab Saudi dan dibantu oleh majelis dewan kota yang dipilih oleh masyarakat setempat sebanyak empat belas orang. Kota Makkah juga merupakan ibu kota dari Provinsi Makkah, di mana sejak tanggal 16 Mei 2007, yang diangkat menjadi Gubernur provinsi tersebut adalah Pangeran Khalid Al Faisal.[15]\nKota Makkah dikenal sebagai kota dagang, pada masa lalu dikenal dengan jalur perdagangan antara Yaman-Mekkah-Madinah-Damsyiq (Damaskus) dengan penghasilan sekali pemberangkatan kafilah mencapai 600.000 pound. Selain dikenal kota dagang, ekonomi juga bertumpu dengan pertanian dan peternakan serta pelayanan jasa untuk jemaah haji di antaranya usaha perhotelan dan penginapan.\nSebagai pusat agama Islam selain Madinah, kota ini memiliki pusat pusat pendidikan dan pengajaran agama Islam.\nPendidikan formal telah mulai dikembangkan sejak akhir periode Usmani perlahan terus sampai kemudian pada tahun 1912, Muhammad Ali Zaynal  ø Ridha, seorang pedagang dari Jeddah, mendirikan Madrasah al-Falah di Makkah dengan biaya waktu itu ¬£400.000.[16]\nSampai pada tahun 2005, di Makkah terdapat 532 sekolah umum atau swasta untuk pria dan 681 sekolah umum atau swasta untuk siswa perempuan.[17]\nSedangkan perguruan tinggi pertama kali didirikan di kota ini adalah sekitar tahun 1949, dengan nama Kulliyyat al-Shar'√≠a, yang kemudian menjadi Fakultas Shar'iah dari Universitas King Abdul Aziz yang berada di Jeddah.[18]\nSebagai kota suci umat Islam dan tempat menunaikan ibadah haji, kota Makkah setiap tahunnya menerima kunjungan dari umat Islam dari berbagai negara, tentunya fasilitas kesehatan merupakan fasilitas pendukung utama yang menjadi perhatian khusus bagi pemerintah Arab Saudi.[18]\nMasjidilharam, kadang kala disebut juga dengan Masjid al-Haram ataupun Al-Masjid al-·∏§arƒÅm (Arab: ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ÿßŸÖ), merupakan masjid yang terletak di Kota Makkah Al Mukharamah, yang dibangun mengelilingi Ka'bah, yang menjadi arah kiblat umat Islam dalam mengerjakan ibadah salat. Selain itu di masjid inilah salah satu rukun ibadah haji yang wajib dilakukan umat Islam yaitu tawaf, mengelilingi Ka'bah sebanyak tujuh kali.\nSebagai kota suci umat Islam, berdasarkan hukum yang berlaku di Arab Saudi, bagi non-Muslim tidak diizinkan memasuki kota Mekkah ini.[19]\nKa'bah (Arab: ÿßŸÑŸÉÿπÿ®ÿ©) merupakan sebuah bangunan yang mendekati bentuk kubus yang terletak di tengah Masjidil Haram di Kota Makkah. Bangunan ini adalah monumen suci bagi umat Islam. Dan bangunan ini yang menjadi patokan arah kiblat untuk ibadah salat, bagi umat Islam di seluruh dunia.\nZamzam (Arab: ÿ≤ŸÖÿ≤ŸÖ) merupakan nama air yang diperoleh dari sebuah sumur mata air bawah tanah yang terletak dalam kawasan Masjidilharam, sebelah tenggara Ka'bah, dengan kedalaman sekitar 42 meter. Air zamzam ini merupakan sumber air bersih utama bagi kota Makkah. Selain dikonsumsi untuk air minum, air ini juga digunakan sebagai air wudu bagi jemaah yang akan melakukan ibadah salat di Masjidilharam.\nSelain Makkah, kota atau daerah yang digunakan dalam peribadatan haji yakni Mina, Muzdalifah, dan Arafah, kemudian terdapat kota atau daerah yang digunakan para jemaah haji untuk memulai prosesinya antara lain Bir Ali atau Dzulkulaifah yang berada di luar kota Madinah sebagai patokan jemaah yang berasal dari Madinah, serta Qarnul Manazil atau Yalamlam bagi jemaah haji yang masuk dari arah Yaman.\n",

        "text": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Mecca ]*\n\n\n\nMecca, officially Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: ŸÖŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÉÿ±ŸÖÿ©‚Äé, romanized:¬†Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit.‚Äâ'Makkah the Noble') and commonly shortened to Makkah,[a] is the holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Mecca Province of Saudi Arabia.[2] The city is 70¬†km (43¬†mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277¬†m (909¬†ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was 1,578,722 in 2015.[3] The estimated metro population in 2020 is 2.042¬†million, making it the third-most populated city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Jeddah. Pilgrims more than triple this number every year during the ·∏§ajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dh≈´l-·∏§ijjah.\nMecca is the birthplace of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur (\"Mountain of Light\") is just outside the city and is where Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad.[4] Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla), cementing Mecca's significance in Islam.[5]\nMuslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, the city has seen several regime changes. The city was finally conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by Ibn Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait, the world's fourth-tallest building and third-largest by floor area, towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has also carried out the destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites,[6] such as the Ajyad Fortress.[7][8][9] Non-Muslims (Kuffar) are strictly prohibited from entering the city.[10][11]\nMuslims from around the world visit the city, not only for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, but also as tourists to visit regional landmarks such as the 'Aisha Mosque (Masjid 'Aisha) and the sites visited by pilgrims in the Hajj and 'Umrah. Mecca is now home to two of the most expensive buildings in the world, the Masjid al-Haram, valued at 100¬†billion US dollars, and the Abraj al-Bait complex, valued at 15¬†billion US dollars.\nUnder the Saudi government, Mecca is governed by the Mecca Regional Municipality, a municipal council of 14 locally elected members headed by the mayor (called Amin in Arabic) appointed by the Saudi government. As of May¬†2015[update], the mayor of the city is Dr. Osama bin Fadhel Al-Barr.[12][13] The City of Mecca amanah, which constitutes Mecca and the surrounding region, is the capital of the Mecca Province, which includes the neighboring cities of Jeddah and Ta'if, even though Jeddah is considerably larger in population compared to Mecca. The Provincial Governor of the province from 16 May 2007 is Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud.[14]\nMecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, its etymology is obscure.[15] Widely believed to be a synonym for Makkah, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah.[16][17]\nMakkah\n\nThe Quran refers to the city as Makkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96, \"Indeed the first House [of worship], established for mankind was that at Makkah...\"\n‚Äì Quran 3:96 This is presumed to have been the name of the city at the time of Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition) and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca, Bekka, among others.[18][19][20]\nMakkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca\nIn South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, the b and m were interchangeable. This is presumed to have been the origin of the current form of the name. \"Makkah\" is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation.[21][22] The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but is not universally known or used worldwide.[21] The full official name is Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: ŸÖŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÉÿ±ŸÖÿ©‚Äé, romanized:¬†Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit.‚Äâ'Makkah the Honored').[21] \"Makkah\" is used to refer to the city in the Quran in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.[15][23]\nThe word \"Mecca\" in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large numbers of people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this spelling for the city as offensive.[21]  Nonetheless, Mecca is the familiar form of the English transliteration for the Arabic name of the city.\nThe historic consensus in academic scholarship has long been that \"Macoraba\", the place mentioned in Arabia Felix by Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca.[24] More recent study has questioned this association.[25] Many etymologies have been proposed: the traditional one is that it is derived from the Old South Arabian root \"M-K-R-B\" which means temple.[25]\nOther names\nAnother name used for Mecca in the Quran is at 6:92 where it is called Umm al-QurƒÅ[26] (ÿ£ŸèŸÖŸë Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÇŸèÿ±ŸéŸâ, meaning \"Mother of all Settlements\".[23] The city has been called several other names in both the Quran and ahadith. Another name used historically for Mecca is TihƒÅmah.[27] According to Arab and Islamic tradition, another name for Mecca, FƒÅrƒÅn, is synonymous with the Desert of Paran mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21:21.[28] Arab and Islamic tradition holds that the wilderness of Paran, broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca.[28] Yaqut al-Hamawi, the 12th century Syrian geographer, wrote that FƒÅrƒÅn was \"an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned in the Torah.\"[29]\nIn 2010, Mecca and the surrounding area became an important site for paleontology with respect to primate evolution, with the discovery of a Saadanius fossil. Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the Old World monkeys and apes. The fossil habitat, near what is now the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia, was a damp forest area between 28¬†million and 29¬†million years ago.[30] Paleontologists involved in the research hope to find further fossils in the area.[31]\nThe early history of Mecca is still largely disputed, as there are no unambiguous references to it in ancient literature prior to the rise of Islam[32] and no architecture from the time of Muhammad.[33] The Roman Empire took control of part of the Hejaz in 106 CE,[34] ruling cities such as Hegra (now known as Mada'in Saleh), located around 800¬†km (500¬†mi) north of Mecca. Even though detailed descriptions of Western Arabia were established by the Romans, such as by Procopius, there are no references of a pilgrimage and trading outpost such as Mecca.[35]\nThe first direct reference to Mecca in external literature occurs in 741 CE, in the Byzantine-Arab Chronicle, though here the author places it in Mesopotamia rather than the Hejaz.[35] Given the inhospitable environment,[36] and lack of historical references in Roman, Persian and Indian sources, historians including Patricia Crone and Tom Holland have cast doubt on the claim that Mecca was a major historical trading outpost.[36][37] However, other scholars such as Glen W. Bowersock disagree and assert that Mecca was a major trading outpost.[38][39][40]\nPotential ancient references\nThe Greek historian Diodorus Siculus writes about Arabia in his work Bibliotheca historica, describing a holy shrine: \"And a temple has been set up there, which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians\".[41] Claims have been made this could be a reference to the Ka'bah in Mecca. However, the geographic location Diodorus describes is located in northwest Arabia, around the area of Leuke Kome, closer to Petra and within the former Nabataean Kingdom and Roman province of Arabia Petraea.[42][43][44]\nPtolemy lists the names of 50 cities in Arabia, one going by the name of \"Macoraba\". There has been speculation since 1646 that this could be a reference to Mecca, but many scholars see no compelling explanation to link the two names.[45] Bowersock favors the identity of the former, with his theory being that \"Macoraba\" is the word \"Makkah\" followed by the aggrandizing Aramaic adjective rabb (great). The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus also enumerated many cities of Western Arabia, most of which can be identified. According to Bowersock, he did mention Mecca as \"Geapolis\" or \"Hierapolis\", the latter one meaning \"holy city\", referring to the sanctuary of the Kaaba, well known already in pagan times.[46] Patricia Crone, from the Revisionist school of Islamic studies on the other hand, writes that \"the plain truth is that the name Macoraba has nothing to do with that of Mecca [...] if Ptolemy mentions Mecca at all, he calls it Moka, a town in Arabia Petraea\"[47] (in northwest Arabia near present-day Petra).\nMecca is mentioned in the following early Quranic manuscripts:\nIslamic narrative\nIn the Islamic view, the beginnings of Mecca are attributed to the Biblical figures, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael. The civilization of Mecca is believed to have started after IbrƒÅhƒ´m (Abraham) left his son IsmƒÅ øƒ´l (Ishmael) and wife HƒÅjar (Hagar) in the valley at Allah's command.[citation needed] Some people from the Yemeni tribe of Jurhum settled with them, and Isma'il reportedly married two women, one after divorcing the first, on Ibrahim's advice. At least one man of the Jurhum helped IsmƒÅ øƒ´l and his father to construct or according to Islamic narratives, reconstruct, the Ka'bah ('Cube'),[48][16][49] which would have social, religious, political and historical implications for the site and region.[50][51]\nMuslims see the mention of a pilgrimage at the Valley of Baca in the Old Testament chapter Psalm 84:3‚Äì6 as a reference to Mecca, similar to the Quran at Surah 3:96.[16] In the Shar·∏• al-AsƒÅ·π≠ƒ´r, a commentary on the Samaritan midrashic chronology of the Patriarchs, of unknown date but probably composed in the 10th century CE, it is claimed that Mecca was built by the sons of Nebaioth, the eldest son of IsmƒÅ øƒ´l or Ishmael.[52][53][54]\nThamudic inscriptions\nSome Thamudic inscriptions which were discovered in the south Jordan contained names of some individuals such as  øAbd Mekkat (ÿπŸéÿ®ŸíÿØ ŸÖŸéŸÉŸéŸëÿ©, \"Servant of Mecca\").[55]\nThere were also some other inscriptions which contained personal names such as Makki (ŸÖŸéŸÉŸêŸëŸä, \"Makkahn\"), but Jawwad Ali from the University of Baghdad suggested that there's also a probability of a tribe named \"Makkah\".[56]\nSome time in the 5th century, the Ka'bah was a place of worship for the deities of Arabia's pagan tribes. Mecca's most important pagan deity was Hubal, which had been placed there by the ruling Quraish tribe.[57][58] and remained until the Conquest of Mecca by Muhammad.[citation needed] In the 5th century, the Quraish took control of Mecca, and became skilled merchants and traders. In the 6th century, they joined the lucrative spice trade, since battles elsewhere were diverting trade routes from dangerous sea routes to more secure overland routes. The Byzantine Empire had previously controlled the Red Sea, but piracy had been increasing.[citation needed] Another previous route that ran through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was also being threatened by exploitations from the Sassanid Empire, and was being disrupted by the Lakhmids, the Ghassanids, and the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars. Mecca's prominence as a trading center also surpassed the cities of Petra and Palmyra.[59][60] The Sassanids however did not always pose a threat to Mecca, as in 575 CE they protected it from a Yemeni invasion, led by its Christian leader Abraha. The tribes of southern Arabia asked the Persian king Khosrau I for aid, in response to which he came south to Arabia with foot-soldiers and a fleet of ships near Mecca.[61]\nBy the middle of the 6th century, there were three major settlements in northern Arabia, all along the south-western coast that borders the Red Sea, in a habitable region between the sea and the Hejaz mountains to the east. Although the area around Mecca was completely barren, it was the wealthiest of the three settlements with abundant water from the renowned Zamzam Well and a position at the crossroads of major caravan routes.[62]\nThe harsh conditions and terrain of the Arabian peninsula meant a near-constant state of conflict between the local tribes, but once a year they would declare a truce and converge upon Mecca in an annual pilgrimage. Up to the 7th century, this journey was intended for religious reasons by the pagan Arabs to pay homage to their shrine, and to drink Zamzam. However, it was also the time each year that disputes would be arbitrated, debts would be resolved, and trading would occur at Meccan fairs. These annual events gave the tribes a sense of common identity and made Mecca an important focus for the peninsula.[63]\nThe Year of the Elephant (570 CE)\nThe \"Year of the Elephant\" is the name in Islamic history for the year approximately equating to 550-552 CE, when, according to Islamic sources such as Ibn Ishaq, Abraha descended upon Mecca, riding an elephant, with a large army after building a cathedral at San'aa, named al-Qullays in honor of the Negus of Axum. It gained widespread fame, even gaining attention from the Byzantine Empire.[64] Abraha attempted to divert the pilgrimage of the Arabs from the Ka'bah to al-Qullays, effectively converting them to Christianity. According to Islamic tradition, this was the year of Muhammad's birth.[64] Abraha allegedly sent a messenger named Muhammad ibn Khuza'i to Mecca and Tihamah with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols.[64] When Muhammad ibn Khuza'i got as far as the land of Kinana, the people of the lowland, knowing what he had come for, sent a man of Hudhayl called  øUrwa bin Hayyad al-Milasi, who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with him, fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and fury and he swore to raid the Kinana tribe and destroy the Ka'bah. Ibn Ishaq further states that one of the men of the Quraysh tribe was angered by this, and going to Sana'a, entering the church at night and defiling it; widely assumed to have done so by defecating in it.[65][66]\nAbraha marched upon the Ka'bah with a large army, which included one or more war elephants, intending to demolish it. When news of the advance of his army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinanah, Khuza'a and Hudhayl united in the defense of the Ka'bah and the city. A man from the Himyarite Kingdom was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Ka'bah and if they resisted, they would be crushed. Abdul Muttalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he and some members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying,[citation needed] \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure he will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\" Abraha eventually attacked Mecca. However, the lead elephant, known as Mahmud,[67] is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca and refused to enter. It has been theorized that an epidemic such as by smallpox could have caused such a failed invasion of Mecca.[68] The reference to the story in Quran is rather short. According to the 115th Surah of the Quran, Al-Fil, the next day, a dark cloud of small birds sent by Allah appeared. The birds carried small rocks in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them to a state like that of eaten straw.[69]\nEconomy\nCamel caravans, said to have first been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were a major part of Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods ‚Äì leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local mountains ‚Äì to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Shaam and Iraq.[70] Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia.[citation needed] The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim. Other regional powers such as the Abyssinians, Ghassanids, and Lakhmids were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century.[63]\nMuhammad was born in Mecca in 570, and thus Islam has been inextricably linked with it ever since. He was born in a faction, the Banu Hashim, of the ruling Quraysh tribe. It was in Mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of Hira on Jabal al-Nour, that, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad began receiving divine revelations from God through the archangel Jibreel in 610 AD. Advocating his form of Abrahamic monotheism against Meccan paganism, and after enduring persecution from the pagan tribes for 13 years, Muhammad emigrated to Medina (hijrah) in 622 with his companions, the Muhajirun, to Yathrib (later renamed Medina). The conflict between the Quraysh and the Muslims is accepted to have begun at this point. Overall, Meccan efforts to annihilate Islam failed and proved to be costly and unsuccessful.[citation needed] During the Battle of the Trench in 627, the combined armies of Arabia were unable to defeat Muhammad's forces.[71]\nIn 628, Muhammad and his followers wanted to enter Mecca for pilgrimage, but were blocked by the Quraysh. Subsequently, Muslims and Meccans entered into the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, whereby the Quraysh and their allies promised to cease fighting Muslims and their allies and promised that Muslims would be allowed into the city to perform the pilgrimage the following year. It was meant to be a ceasefire for 10 years; however, just two years later, the Banu Bakr, allies of the Quraish, violated the truce by slaughtering a group of the Banu Khuza'ah, allies of the Muslims. Muhammad and his companions, now 10,000 strong, marched into Mecca and conquered the city. The pagan imagery was destroyed by Muhammad's followers and the location Islamized and rededicated to the worship of Allah alone. Mecca was declared the holiest site in Islam ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage (Hajj), one of the faith's Five Pillars. Muhammad then returned to Medina, after assigning 'Akib ibn Usaid as governor of the city. His other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula under the banner of Islam.[59][71] Muhammad died in 632. Within the next few hundred years, the area under the banner of Islam stretched from North Africa into Asia and parts of Europe. As the Islamic realm grew, Mecca continued to attract pilgrims from all across the Muslim world and beyond, as Muslims came to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Mecca also attracted a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, pilgrims arrived by boat at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq.[citation needed]\nMecca was never the capital of any of the Islamic states. Muslim rulers did contribute to its upkeep, such as during the reigns of 'Umar (r. 634‚Äì644 CE) and 'Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644‚Äì656 CE) when concerns of flooding caused the caliphs to bring in Christian engineers to build barrages in the low-lying quarters and construct dykes and embankments to protect the area round the Kaaba.[59]\nMuhammad's return to Medina shifted the focus away from Mecca and later even further away when 'Ali, the fourth caliph, took power chose Kufa as his capital. The Umayyad Caliphate moved the capital to Damascus in Syria and the Abbasid Caliphate to Baghdad, in modern-day Iraq, which remained the center of the Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history during the Second Fitna, when it was held by Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr and the Zubayrids.[citation needed] The city was twice besieged by the Umayyads, in 683 and 692 and for some time thereafter, the city figured little in politics, remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by various other factions. In 930, Mecca was attacked and sacked by Qarmatians, a millenarian Shi'a Isma'ili Muslim sect led by Ab≈´-TƒÅhir Al-JannƒÅbƒ´ and centered in eastern Arabia.[72] The Black Death pandemic hit Mecca in 1349.[73]\nMecca, ca. 1718 CE\nMecca, ca. 1778 CE\nMecca, in the 1880s\nMecca in 1910\nPilgrims surround the Ka'bah in 1910\nOne of the most famous travelers to Mecca in the 14th century was Moroccan scholar and traveler, Ibn Battuta. In his rihla (account), he provides a vast description of the city. Around the year 1327 CE or 729 AH, Ibn Battuta arrived at the holy city. Immediately, he says, it felt like a holy sanctuary and thus. he started the rites of the pilgrimage. He remained in Mecca for three years and left in 1330 CE. During his second year in the holy city, he says his caravan arrived \"with a great quantity of alms for the support of those who were staying in Mecca and Medina\". While in Mecca, prayers were made for (not to) the King of Iraq and also for Salaheddin al-Ayyubi, Sultan of Egypt and Syria at the Ka'bah. Battuta says the Ka'bah was large, but was destroyed and rebuilt smaller than the original and that it contained images of angels and prophets including Jesus, his mother Mary and many others. Battuta describes the Ka'bah as an important part of Mecca due to the fact that many people make the pilgrimage to it. Battuta describes the people of the city as being humble and kind, and also willing to give a part of everything they had to someone who had nothing. The inhabitants of Mecca and the village itself, he says, were very clean. There was also a sense of elegance to the village.[74]\nUnder the Ottomans\nIn 1517, the then Sharif of Mecca, Barakat bin Muhammad, acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Caliph but retained a great degree of local autonomy.[75] In 1803 the city was captured by the First Saudi State,[76] which held Mecca until 1813. destroying some of the historic tombs and domes in and around the city. The Ottomans assigned the task of bringing Mecca back under Ottoman control to their powerful Khedive (viceroy) and Wali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha. Muhammad Ali Pasha successfully returned Mecca to Ottoman control in 1813. In 1818, the Saud were defeated again but survived and founded the Second Saudi State that lasted until 1891 and led on to the present country of Saudi Arabia. In 1853, Sir Richard Francis Burton undertook the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina disguised as a Muslim. Although Burton was certainly not the first non-Muslim European to make the Hajj (Ludovico di Varthema did this in 1503),[77] his pilgrimage remains one of the most famous and documented of modern times. Mecca was regularly hit by cholera outbreaks. Between 1830 and 1930, cholera broke out among pilgrims at Mecca 27 times.[78]\nHashemite Revolt and subsequent control by the Sharifate of Mecca\nIn World War I, the Ottoman Empire was at war with the Allies. It had successfully repulsed an attack on Istanbul in the Gallipoli campaign and on Baghdad in the Siege of Kut. The British intelligence agent T.E. Lawrence conspired with the Ottoman governor, Hussain bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and it was the first city captured by his forces in the 1916 Battle of Mecca. Sharif's revolt proved a turning point of the war on the eastern front. Hussein declared a new state, the Kingdom of Hejaz, declaring himself the Sharif of the state and Mecca his capital. News reports in November 1916 via contact in Cairo with returning Hajj pilgrims, stated that with the Ottoman Turkish authorities gone, the Hajj of 1916 was free of the previous massive extortion and monetary demands made by the Turks who were agents of the Ottoman government.[79]\nSaudi Arabian conquest and modern history\nFollowing the 1924 Battle of Mecca, the Sharif of Mecca was overthrown by the Saud family, and Mecca was incorporated into Saudi Arabia.[80] Under Saudi rule, much of the historic city has been demolished as a result of the Saudi government fearing these sites might become sites of association in worship beside Allah (shirk). The city has been expanded to include several towns previously considered to be separate from the holy city and now is just a few kilometers outside the main sites of the Hajj, Mina, Muzdalifah and Arafat. Mecca is not served by any airport, due to concerns about the city's safety. It is instead served by the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah (approx. 70¬†km away) internationally and the Ta'if Regional Airport (approx. 120¬†km away) for domestic flights.[citation needed]\nThe city today is at the junction of the two most important highways in all of the Saudi Arabian highway system, Highway 40, which connects the city to Jeddah in the west and the capital, Riyadh and Dammam in the east and Highway 15, which connects it to Medina, Tabuk and onward to Jordan in the north and Abha and Jizan in the south. The Ottomans had planned to extend their railway network to the holy city, but were forced to abandon this plan due to their partaking in the First World War. This plan was later carried out by the Saudi government, which connected the two holy cities of Medina and Mecca with the modern Haramain high-speed railway system which runs at 300¬†km/h (190¬†mph) and connects the two cities via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh within two hours.[citation needed]\nThe haram area of Mecca, in which the entry of non-Muslims is forbidden, is much larger than that of Medina.\n1979 Grand Mosque seizureOn 20 November 1979, two hundred armed dissidents led by Juhayman al-Otaibi, seized the Grand Mosque, claiming the Saudi royal family no longer represented pure Islam and that the Masjid al-Haram and the Ka'bah, must be held by those of true faith. The rebels seized tens of thousands of pilgrims as hostages and barricaded themselves in the mosque. The siege lasted two weeks, and resulted in several hundred deaths and significant damage to the shrine, especially the Safa-Marwah gallery. A multinational force was finally able to retake the mosque from the dissidents.[81] Since then, the Grand Mosque has been expanded several times, with many other expansions being undertaken in the present-day.\nDestruction of Islamic heritage sitesUnder Saudi rule, it has been estimated that since 1985, about 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, have been demolished.[7][82] It has been reported that there are now fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad. Some important buildings that have been destroyed include the house of Khadijah, the wife of Muhammad, the house of Abu Bakr, Muhammad's birthplace and the Ottoman-era Ajyad Fortress.[83] The reason for much of the destruction of historic buildings has been for the construction of hotels, apartments, parking lots, and other infrastructure facilities for Hajj pilgrims.[82]\nIncidents during pilgrimageMecca has been the site of several incidents and failures of crowd control because of the large numbers of people who come to make the Hajj.[84][85][86] For example, on 2 July 1990, a pilgrimage to Mecca ended in tragedy when the ventilation system failed in a crowded pedestrian tunnel and 1,426 people were either suffocated or trampled to death in a stampede.[87] On 24 September 2015, 700 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at Mina during the stoning-the-Devil ritual at Jamarat.[88]\nMecca holds an important place in Islam and is the holiest city in all branches of the religion. The city derives its importance from the role it plays in the Hajj and 'Umrah.\nThe Masjid al-Haram is the largest mosque in the world and the most expensive single building in the entire world, valued at 100¬†billion US dollars, as of 2020.[89] It is the site of two of the most important rites of both the Hajj and of the Umrah, the circumambulation around the Ka'bah (tawaf) and the walking between the two mounts of Safa and Marwa (sa'ee). The masjid is also the site of the Zamzam Well. According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in the masjid is equal to 100,000 prayers in any other masjid around the world.[90]\nThere is a difference of opinion between Islamic scholars upon who first built the Ka'bah, some believe it was built by the angels while others believe it was built by Adam. Regardless, it was built several times before reaching its current state, the most famous of these renovations being the one by Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition). The Ka'bah is also the common direction of prayer (qibla) for all Muslims. The surface surrounding the Ka'bah on which Muslims circumambulate it is known as the Mataf.\nThe Black Stone is a stone, considered by scientists to be a meteorite or of similar origin and believed by Muslims to be of divine origin. It is set in the eastern corner of the Ka‚Äôbah and it is Sunnah to touch and kiss the stone. The area around the stone is generally always crowded and guarded by policemen to ensure the pilgrims' safety.\nThis is the stone which Abraham stood on to build the higher parts of the Ka'bah. It contains two footprints that are comparatively larger than average modern-day human feet. The stone is raised and housed in a golden hexagonal chamber beside the Ka'bah on the Mataf plate.\n\nMuslims believe that in the divine revelation to Muhammad, the Quran, Allah describes the mountains of Safa and Marwah as symbols of his divinity. Walking between the two mountains seven times, 4 times from Safa to Marwah and 3 times from Marwah interchangeably, is considered a mandatory pillar (rukn) of 'Umrah.\nThe Hajj pilgrimage, also called the greater pilgrimage, attracts millions of Muslims from all over the world and almost triples Mecca's population for one week in the twelfth and final Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah. In 2019, the Hajj attracted 2,489,406 pilgrims to the holy city.[91] The 'Umrah, or the lesser pilgrimage, can be done at anytime during the year.  Every adult, healthy Muslim who has the financial and physical capacity to travel to Mecca must perform the Hajj at least once in a lifetime. Umrah, the lesser pilgrimage, is not obligatory, but is recommended in the Quran.[92] In addition to the Masjid al-Haram, pilgrims also must visit the nearby towns of Mina/Muna, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat for various rituals that are part of the Hajj.This is a mountain believed by Muslims to have been the place where Muhammad spent his time away from the bustling city of Mecca in seclusion.[93][94] The mountain is located on the eastern entrance of the city and is the highest point in the city at 642 meters (2,106 feet).\nSituated atop Jabal an-Nur, this is the place where Muslims believe Muhammad received the first revelation from Allah through the archangel Gabriel (Jibril in Islamic tradition) at the age of 40.[93][94]\nMecca is located in the Hejaz region, a 200¬†km (124¬†mi) wide strip of mountains separating the Nafud desert from the Red Sea. The city is situated in a valley with the same name around 70¬†km (44¬†mi) west of the port city of Jeddah. Mecca is one of the lowest cities in elevation in the Hejaz region, located at an elevation of 277¬†m (909¬†ft) above sea level at 21¬∫23' north latitude and 39¬∫51' east longitude. Mecca is divided into 34 districts.\nThe city centers on the al-Haram area, which contains the Masjid al-Haram. The area around the mosque is the old city and contains the most famous district of Mecca, Ajyad. The main street that runs to al-Haram is the Ibrahim al-Khalil Street, named after Ibrahim. Traditional, historical homes built of local rock, two to three stories long are still present within the city's central area, within view of modern hotels and shopping complexes. The total area of modern Mecca is over 1,200¬†km2 (460¬†sq¬†mi).[95]\nMecca is at an elevation of 277¬†m (909¬†ft) above sea level, and approximately 70¬†km (44¬†mi) inland from the Red Sea.[62] It is one of the lowest in the Hejaz region.\nThe city center lies in a corridor between mountains, which is often called the \"Hollow of Mecca\". The area contains the valley of al-Taneem, the valley of Bakkah and the valley of Abqar.[59][96] This mountainous location has defined the contemporary expansion of the city.\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the city used a few chief sources of water. The first were local wells, such as the Zamzam Well, that produced generally brackish water. The second source was the spring of 'Ayn Zubaydah (Spring of Zubaydah). The sources of this spring are the mountains of Jabal Sa'd and Jabal KabkƒÅb, which are a few kilometers east of 'Arafah/'Arafat or about 20¬†km (12¬†mi) southeast of Mecca. Water was transported from it using underground channels. A very sporadic third source was rainfall which was stored by the people in small reservoirs or cisterns. The rainfall, scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since earliest times. According to al-Kurdƒ´, there have been 89 floods by 1965. In the last century, the most severe flood was that of 1942. Since then, dams have been built to ameliorate this problem.[96]\n\nMecca features a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen: BWh), in three different plant hardiness zones: 10, 11 and 12.[97] Like most Saudi Arabian cities, Mecca retains warm to hot temperatures even in winter, which can range from 19¬†¬∞C (66¬†¬∞F) at night to 30¬†¬∞C (86¬†¬∞F) in the afternoon, but also, very rarely, fall to zero and subzero temperatures. Summer temperatures are extremely hot and consistently break the 40¬†¬∞C (104¬†¬∞F) mark in the afternoon, dropping to 30¬†¬∞C (86¬†¬∞F) in the evening, but humidity remains relatively low, at 30‚Äì40%. Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts scattered between November and January, with heavy thunderstorms also common during the winter.The Meccan economy has been heavily dependent on the annual pilgrimage. Income generated from the Hajj, in fact, not only powers the Meccan economy but has historically had far-reaching effects on the economy of the entire Arabian Peninsula. The income was generated in a number of ways. One method was taxing the pilgrims. Taxes were especially increased during the Great Depression, and many of these taxes existed to as late as 1972. Another way the Hajj generates income is through services to pilgrims. For example, the Saudi flag carrier, Saudia, generates 12% of its income from the pilgrimage. Fares paid by pilgrims to reach Mecca by land also generate income; as do the hotels and lodging companies that house them.[96] The city takes in more than $100¬†million, while the Saudi government spends about $50¬†million on services for the Hajj. There are some industries and factories in the city, but Mecca no longer plays a major role in Saudi Arabia's economy, which is mainly based on oil exports.[100] The few industries operating in Mecca include textiles, furniture, and utensils. The majority of the economy is service-oriented.\nNevertheless, many industries have been set up in Mecca. Various types of enterprises that have existed since 1970 in the city include corrugated iron manufacturing, copper extraction, carpentry, upholstery, bakeries, farming and banking.[96] The city has grown substantially in the 20th and 21st centuries, as the convenience and affordability of jet travel has increased the number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. Thousands of Saudis are employed year-round to oversee the Hajj and staff the hotels and shops that cater to pilgrims; these workers in turn have increased the demand for housing and services. The city is now ringed by freeways, and contains shopping malls and skyscrapers.[101]\nFormal education started to be developed in the late Ottoman period continuing slowly into Hashemite times. The first major attempt to improve the situation was made by a Jeddah merchant, Muhammad  øAlƒ´ Zaynal Ri·∏çƒÅ, who founded the Madrasat al-FalƒÅ·∏• in Mecca in 1911‚Äì12 that cost ¬£400,000.[96] The school system in Mecca has many public and private schools for both males and females. As of 2005, there were 532 public and private schools for males and another 681 public and private schools for female students.[102] The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, but some private schools founded by foreign entities such as International schools use the English language as the medium of instruction. Some of these are coeducational while other schools are not. For higher education, the city has only one university, Umm Al-Qura University, which was established in 1949 as a college and became a public university in 1981.\nHealthcare is provided by the Saudi government free-of-charge to all pilgrims. There are ten main hospitals in Mecca:[103]\nThere are also many walk-in clinics available for both residents and pilgrims. Several temporary clinics are set up during the Hajj to tend to wounded pilgrims.\nIn February 2020, Saudi Arabia temporarily banned foreigners from entering Mecca and Medina to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom.[104]\nMecca's culture has been affected by the large number of pilgrims that arrive annually, and thus boasts a rich cultural heritage. As a result of the vast numbers of pilgrims coming to the city each year, Mecca has become by far the most diverse city in the Muslim world. In contrast to the rest of Saudi Arabia, and particularly Najd, Mecca has, according to The New York Times, become \"a striking oasis of free thought and discussion and, also, of unlikely liberalism as Meccans see themselves as a bulwark against the creeping extremism that has overtaken much Islamic debate\".[9]\nAl Baik, a local fast-food chain, is very popular among pilgrims and locals alike. Until 2018, it was available only in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah, and traveling to Jeddah just to get a taste of the fried chicken was common.\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the most common sports were impromptu wrestling and foot races.[96] Football is now the most popular sport in Mecca and the kingdom, and the city hosts some of the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia such as Al Wahda FC (established in 1945). King Abdulaziz Stadium is the largest stadium in Mecca with a capacity of 38,000.[105]\nMecca is very densely populated. Most long-term residents live in the Old City, the area around the Great Mosque and many work to support pilgrims, known locally as the Hajj industry. 'Iyad Madani, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Hajj, was quoted saying, \"We never stop preparing for the Hajj.\"[106]\nYear-round, pilgrims stream into the city to perform the rites of 'Umrah, and during the last weeks of eleventh Islamic month, Dhu al-Qi'dah, on average 2-4¬†million Muslims arrive in the city to take part in the rites known as Hajj.[107] Pilgrims are from varying ethnicities and backgrounds, mainly South and Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. Many of these pilgrims have remained and become residents of the city. The Burmese are an older, more established community who number roughly 250,000.[108] Adding to this, the discovery of oil in the past 50 years has brought hundreds of thousands of working immigrants.\nNon-Muslims are not permitted to enter Mecca under Saudi law,[10] and using fraudulent documents to do so may result in arrest and prosecution.[109] The prohibition extends to Ahmadis, as they are considered non-Muslims.[110] Nevertheless, many non-Muslims and Ahmadis have visited the city as these restrictions are loosely enforced. The first such recorded example of a non-Muslim entering the city is that of Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna in 1503.[111] Guru Nanak Sahib, the founder of Sikhism, visited Mecca[112] in December 1518.[113] One of the most famous was Richard Francis Burton,[114] who traveled as a Qadiriyya Sufi from Afghanistan in 1853.\nMecca Province is the only province where expatriates outnumber Saudis.[115]\nAdorning the southern facade of the Masjid al-Haram, the Abraj al-Bait Complex, which towers over the Great Mosque, is a seven-building complex with the central clock tower having a length of 601 m (1,972 feet), making it the world's fourth-tallest building. All seven buildings in the complex also form the third-largest building by floor area. \nThe Mecca Gate, known popularly as the Quran Gate, on the western entrance of the city, or from Jeddah. Located on Highway 40, it marks the boundary of the Haram area where non-Muslims are prohibited from entering. The gate was designed in 1979 by an Egyptian architect, Samir Elabd, for the architectural firm IDEA Center. The structure is that of a book, representing the Quran, sitting on a rehal, or bookrest.[116]\nThe first press was brought to Mecca in 1885 by Osman Nuri Pasha, an Ottoman WƒÅli. During the Hashemite period, it was used to print the city's official gazette, Al Qibla. The Saudi regime expanded this press into a larger operation, introducing the new Saudi official gazette of Mecca, Umm al-QurƒÅ.[96] Mecca also has its own paper owned by the city, Al Nadwa. However, other Saudi newspapers are also provided in Mecca such as the Saudi Gazette, Al Madinah, Okaz and Al Bilad, in addition to other international newspapers.\nTelecommunications in the city were emphasized early under the Saudi reign. King Abdulaziz pressed them forward as he saw them as a means of convenience and better governance. While under Hussein bin Ali, there were about 20 public telephones in the entire city; in 1936, the number jumped to 450, totaling about half the telephones in the country. During that time, telephone lines were extended to Jeddah and Ta‚Äôif, but not to the capital, Riyadh. By 1985, Mecca, like other Saudi cities, possessed modern telephone, telex, radio and television communications.[96] Many television stations serving the city area include Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al-Ekhbariya, Arab Radio and Television Network and various cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.\nLimited radio communication was established within the Kingdom under the Hashemites. In 1929, wireless stations were set up in various towns in the region, creating a network that would become fully functional by 1932. Soon after World War II, the existing network was greatly expanded and improved. Since then, radio communication has been used extensively in directing the pilgrimage and addressing the pilgrims. This practice started in 1950, with the initiation of broadcasts on the Day of 'Arafah (9 Dhu al-Hijjah), and increased until 1957, at which time Radio Makkah became the most powerful station in the Middle East at 50¬†kW. Later, power was increased 9-fold to 450¬†kW. Music was not immediately broadcast, but gradually folk music was introduced.[96]\nThe only airport near the city is the Mecca East airport, which is not active. Mecca is primarily served by King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah for international and regional connections and Ta'if Regional Airport for regional connections. To cater the large number of Hajj pilgrims, Jeddah Airport has Hajj Terminal, specifically for use in the Hajj season, which can accommodate 47 planes simultaneously and can receive 3,800 pilgrims per hour during the Hajj season.[117]\nMecca, similar to Medina, lies at the junction of two of the most important highways in Saudi Arabia, Highway 40, connecting it to the important port city of Jeddah in the west and the capital of Riyadh and the other major port city, Dammam, in the east. The other, Highway 15, connects Mecca to the other holy Islamic city of Medina approximately 400¬†km (250¬†mi) in the north and onward to Tabuk and Jordan. While in the south, it connects Mecca to Abha and Jizan.[118][119] Mecca is served by four ring roads, and these are very crowded compared to the three ring roads of Medina.\nAl Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro\nThe Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro is a metro line in Mecca opened on 13 November 2010.[120] The 18.1-kilometer (11.2-mile) elevated metro transports pilgrims to the holy sites of 'Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina in the city to reduce congestion on the road and is only operational during the Hajj season.[121] It consists of nine stations, three in each of the aforementioned towns.\nMecca MetroThe Mecca Metro, officially known as Makkah Mass Rail Transit, is a planned four-line metro system for the city.[122] This will be in addition to[122] the Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro which carries pilgrims.\nIn 2018, a high speed intercity rail line, part of the Haramain High Speed Rail Project, named the Haramain high-speed railway line entered operation, connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina together via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City in Rabigh.[123][124] The railway consists of 35 electric trains and is capable of transporting 60¬†million passengers annually. Each train can achieve speeds of up to 300¬†kmh (190¬†mph), traveling a total distance of 450¬†km (280¬†mi), reducing the travel time between the two cities to less than two hours.[125][124] It was built by a business consortium from Spain.[126]\n",

            "conversation": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Mecca ]*\n\n\n\nMecca, officially Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: ŸÖŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÉÿ±ŸÖÿ©‚Äé, romanized:¬†Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit.‚Äâ'Makkah the Noble') and commonly shortened to Makkah,[a] is the holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Mecca Province of Saudi Arabia.[2] The city is 70¬†km (43¬†mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277¬†m (909¬†ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was 1,578,722 in 2015.[3] The estimated metro population in 2020 is 2.042¬†million, making it the third-most populated city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Jeddah. Pilgrims more than triple this number every year during the ·∏§ajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of Dh≈´l-·∏§ijjah.\nMecca is the birthplace of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur (\"Mountain of Light\") is just outside the city and is where Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad.[4] Visiting Mecca for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Mecca, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla), cementing Mecca's significance in Islam.[5]\nMuslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, and thus, much like most of the Hejaz region, the city has seen several regime changes. The city was finally conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by Ibn Saud and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the Abraj Al Bait, the world's fourth-tallest building and third-largest by floor area, towering over the Great Mosque. The Saudi government has also carried out the destruction of several historical structures and archaeological sites,[6] such as the Ajyad Fortress.[7][8][9] Non-Muslims (Kuffar) are strictly prohibited from entering the city.[10][11]\nMuslims from around the world visit the city, not only for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, but also as tourists to visit regional landmarks such as the 'Aisha Mosque (Masjid 'Aisha) and the sites visited by pilgrims in the Hajj and 'Umrah. Mecca is now home to two of the most expensive buildings in the world, the Masjid al-Haram, valued at 100¬†billion US dollars, and the Abraj al-Bait complex, valued at 15¬†billion US dollars.\nUnder the Saudi government, Mecca is governed by the Mecca Regional Municipality, a municipal council of 14 locally elected members headed by the mayor (called Amin in Arabic) appointed by the Saudi government. As of May¬†2015[update], the mayor of the city is Dr. Osama bin Fadhel Al-Barr.[12][13] The City of Mecca amanah, which constitutes Mecca and the surrounding region, is the capital of the Mecca Province, which includes the neighboring cities of Jeddah and Ta'if, even though Jeddah is considerably larger in population compared to Mecca. The Provincial Governor of the province from 16 May 2007 is Prince Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud.[14]\nMecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, its etymology is obscure.[15] Widely believed to be a synonym for Makkah, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah.[16][17]\nMakkah\n\nThe Quran refers to the city as Makkah in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96, \"Indeed the first House [of worship], established for mankind was that at Makkah...\"\n‚Äì Quran 3:96 This is presumed to have been the name of the city at the time of Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition) and it is also transliterated as Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca, Bekka, among others.[18][19][20]\nMakkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca\nIn South Arabic, the language in use in the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of Muhammad, the b and m were interchangeable. This is presumed to have been the origin of the current form of the name. \"Makkah\" is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation.[21][22] The government adopted Makkah as the official spelling in the 1980s, but is not universally known or used worldwide.[21] The full official name is Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: ŸÖŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÉÿ±ŸÖÿ©‚Äé, romanized:¬†Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit.‚Äâ'Makkah the Honored').[21] \"Makkah\" is used to refer to the city in the Quran in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.[15][23]\nThe word \"Mecca\" in English has come to be used to refer to any place that draws large numbers of people, and because of this some English-speaking Muslims have come to regard the use of this spelling for the city as offensive.[21]  Nonetheless, Mecca is the familiar form of the English transliteration for the Arabic name of the city.\nThe historic consensus in academic scholarship has long been that \"Macoraba\", the place mentioned in Arabia Felix by Claudius Ptolemy, is Mecca.[24] More recent study has questioned this association.[25] Many etymologies have been proposed: the traditional one is that it is derived from the Old South Arabian root \"M-K-R-B\" which means temple.[25]\nOther names\nAnother name used for Mecca in the Quran is at 6:92 where it is called Umm al-QurƒÅ[26] (ÿ£ŸèŸÖŸë Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÇŸèÿ±ŸéŸâ, meaning \"Mother of all Settlements\".[23] The city has been called several other names in both the Quran and ahadith. Another name used historically for Mecca is TihƒÅmah.[27] According to Arab and Islamic tradition, another name for Mecca, FƒÅrƒÅn, is synonymous with the Desert of Paran mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21:21.[28] Arab and Islamic tradition holds that the wilderness of Paran, broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca.[28] Yaqut al-Hamawi, the 12th century Syrian geographer, wrote that FƒÅrƒÅn was \"an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned in the Torah.\"[29]\nIn 2010, Mecca and the surrounding area became an important site for paleontology with respect to primate evolution, with the discovery of a Saadanius fossil. Saadanius is considered to be a primate closely related to the common ancestor of the Old World monkeys and apes. The fossil habitat, near what is now the Red Sea in western Saudi Arabia, was a damp forest area between 28¬†million and 29¬†million years ago.[30] Paleontologists involved in the research hope to find further fossils in the area.[31]\nThe early history of Mecca is still largely disputed, as there are no unambiguous references to it in ancient literature prior to the rise of Islam[32] and no architecture from the time of Muhammad.[33] The Roman Empire took control of part of the Hejaz in 106 CE,[34] ruling cities such as Hegra (now known as Mada'in Saleh), located around 800¬†km (500¬†mi) north of Mecca. Even though detailed descriptions of Western Arabia were established by the Romans, such as by Procopius, there are no references of a pilgrimage and trading outpost such as Mecca.[35]\nThe first direct reference to Mecca in external literature occurs in 741 CE, in the Byzantine-Arab Chronicle, though here the author places it in Mesopotamia rather than the Hejaz.[35] Given the inhospitable environment,[36] and lack of historical references in Roman, Persian and Indian sources, historians including Patricia Crone and Tom Holland have cast doubt on the claim that Mecca was a major historical trading outpost.[36][37] However, other scholars such as Glen W. Bowersock disagree and assert that Mecca was a major trading outpost.[38][39][40]\nPotential ancient references\nThe Greek historian Diodorus Siculus writes about Arabia in his work Bibliotheca historica, describing a holy shrine: \"And a temple has been set up there, which is very holy and exceedingly revered by all Arabians\".[41] Claims have been made this could be a reference to the Ka'bah in Mecca. However, the geographic location Diodorus describes is located in northwest Arabia, around the area of Leuke Kome, closer to Petra and within the former Nabataean Kingdom and Roman province of Arabia Petraea.[42][43][44]\nPtolemy lists the names of 50 cities in Arabia, one going by the name of \"Macoraba\". There has been speculation since 1646 that this could be a reference to Mecca, but many scholars see no compelling explanation to link the two names.[45] Bowersock favors the identity of the former, with his theory being that \"Macoraba\" is the word \"Makkah\" followed by the aggrandizing Aramaic adjective rabb (great). The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus also enumerated many cities of Western Arabia, most of which can be identified. According to Bowersock, he did mention Mecca as \"Geapolis\" or \"Hierapolis\", the latter one meaning \"holy city\", referring to the sanctuary of the Kaaba, well known already in pagan times.[46] Patricia Crone, from the Revisionist school of Islamic studies on the other hand, writes that \"the plain truth is that the name Macoraba has nothing to do with that of Mecca [...] if Ptolemy mentions Mecca at all, he calls it Moka, a town in Arabia Petraea\"[47] (in northwest Arabia near present-day Petra).\nMecca is mentioned in the following early Quranic manuscripts:\nIslamic narrative\nIn the Islamic view, the beginnings of Mecca are attributed to the Biblical figures, Abraham, Hagar and Ishmael. The civilization of Mecca is believed to have started after IbrƒÅhƒ´m (Abraham) left his son IsmƒÅ øƒ´l (Ishmael) and wife HƒÅjar (Hagar) in the valley at Allah's command.[citation needed] Some people from the Yemeni tribe of Jurhum settled with them, and Isma'il reportedly married two women, one after divorcing the first, on Ibrahim's advice. At least one man of the Jurhum helped IsmƒÅ øƒ´l and his father to construct or according to Islamic narratives, reconstruct, the Ka'bah ('Cube'),[48][16][49] which would have social, religious, political and historical implications for the site and region.[50][51]\nMuslims see the mention of a pilgrimage at the Valley of Baca in the Old Testament chapter Psalm 84:3‚Äì6 as a reference to Mecca, similar to the Quran at Surah 3:96.[16] In the Shar·∏• al-AsƒÅ·π≠ƒ´r, a commentary on the Samaritan midrashic chronology of the Patriarchs, of unknown date but probably composed in the 10th century CE, it is claimed that Mecca was built by the sons of Nebaioth, the eldest son of IsmƒÅ øƒ´l or Ishmael.[52][53][54]\nThamudic inscriptions\nSome Thamudic inscriptions which were discovered in the south Jordan contained names of some individuals such as  øAbd Mekkat (ÿπŸéÿ®ŸíÿØ ŸÖŸéŸÉŸéŸëÿ©, \"Servant of Mecca\").[55]\nThere were also some other inscriptions which contained personal names such as Makki (ŸÖŸéŸÉŸêŸëŸä, \"Makkahn\"), but Jawwad Ali from the University of Baghdad suggested that there's also a probability of a tribe named \"Makkah\".[56]\nSome time in the 5th century, the Ka'bah was a place of worship for the deities of Arabia's pagan tribes. Mecca's most important pagan deity was Hubal, which had been placed there by the ruling Quraish tribe.[57][58] and remained until the Conquest of Mecca by Muhammad.[citation needed] In the 5th century, the Quraish took control of Mecca, and became skilled merchants and traders. In the 6th century, they joined the lucrative spice trade, since battles elsewhere were diverting trade routes from dangerous sea routes to more secure overland routes. The Byzantine Empire had previously controlled the Red Sea, but piracy had been increasing.[citation needed] Another previous route that ran through the Persian Gulf via the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was also being threatened by exploitations from the Sassanid Empire, and was being disrupted by the Lakhmids, the Ghassanids, and the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars. Mecca's prominence as a trading center also surpassed the cities of Petra and Palmyra.[59][60] The Sassanids however did not always pose a threat to Mecca, as in 575 CE they protected it from a Yemeni invasion, led by its Christian leader Abraha. The tribes of southern Arabia asked the Persian king Khosrau I for aid, in response to which he came south to Arabia with foot-soldiers and a fleet of ships near Mecca.[61]\nBy the middle of the 6th century, there were three major settlements in northern Arabia, all along the south-western coast that borders the Red Sea, in a habitable region between the sea and the Hejaz mountains to the east. Although the area around Mecca was completely barren, it was the wealthiest of the three settlements with abundant water from the renowned Zamzam Well and a position at the crossroads of major caravan routes.[62]\nThe harsh conditions and terrain of the Arabian peninsula meant a near-constant state of conflict between the local tribes, but once a year they would declare a truce and converge upon Mecca in an annual pilgrimage. Up to the 7th century, this journey was intended for religious reasons by the pagan Arabs to pay homage to their shrine, and to drink Zamzam. However, it was also the time each year that disputes would be arbitrated, debts would be resolved, and trading would occur at Meccan fairs. These annual events gave the tribes a sense of common identity and made Mecca an important focus for the peninsula.[63]\nThe Year of the Elephant (570 CE)\nThe \"Year of the Elephant\" is the name in Islamic history for the year approximately equating to 550-552 CE, when, according to Islamic sources such as Ibn Ishaq, Abraha descended upon Mecca, riding an elephant, with a large army after building a cathedral at San'aa, named al-Qullays in honor of the Negus of Axum. It gained widespread fame, even gaining attention from the Byzantine Empire.[64] Abraha attempted to divert the pilgrimage of the Arabs from the Ka'bah to al-Qullays, effectively converting them to Christianity. According to Islamic tradition, this was the year of Muhammad's birth.[64] Abraha allegedly sent a messenger named Muhammad ibn Khuza'i to Mecca and Tihamah with a message that al-Qullays was both much better than other houses of worship and purer, having not been defiled by the housing of idols.[64] When Muhammad ibn Khuza'i got as far as the land of Kinana, the people of the lowland, knowing what he had come for, sent a man of Hudhayl called  øUrwa bin Hayyad al-Milasi, who shot him with an arrow, killing him. His brother Qays who was with him, fled to Abraha and told him the news, which increased his rage and fury and he swore to raid the Kinana tribe and destroy the Ka'bah. Ibn Ishaq further states that one of the men of the Quraysh tribe was angered by this, and going to Sana'a, entering the church at night and defiling it; widely assumed to have done so by defecating in it.[65][66]\nAbraha marched upon the Ka'bah with a large army, which included one or more war elephants, intending to demolish it. When news of the advance of his army came, the Arab tribes of Quraysh, Kinanah, Khuza'a and Hudhayl united in the defense of the Ka'bah and the city. A man from the Himyarite Kingdom was sent by Abraha to advise them that Abraha only wished to demolish the Ka'bah and if they resisted, they would be crushed. Abdul Muttalib told the Meccans to seek refuge in the hills while he and some members of the Quraysh remained within the precincts of the Kaaba. Abraha sent a dispatch inviting Abdul-Muttalib to meet with Abraha and discuss matters. When Abdul-Muttalib left the meeting he was heard saying,[citation needed] \"The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure he will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House.\" Abraha eventually attacked Mecca. However, the lead elephant, known as Mahmud,[67] is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca and refused to enter. It has been theorized that an epidemic such as by smallpox could have caused such a failed invasion of Mecca.[68] The reference to the story in Quran is rather short. According to the 115th Surah of the Quran, Al-Fil, the next day, a dark cloud of small birds sent by Allah appeared. The birds carried small rocks in their beaks, and bombarded the Ethiopian forces and smashed them to a state like that of eaten straw.[69]\nEconomy\nCamel caravans, said to have first been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were a major part of Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods ‚Äì leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local mountains ‚Äì to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Shaam and Iraq.[70] Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia.[citation needed] The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation of client tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim. Other regional powers such as the Abyssinians, Ghassanids, and Lakhmids were in decline leaving Meccan trade to be the primary binding force in Arabia in the late 6th century.[63]\nMuhammad was born in Mecca in 570, and thus Islam has been inextricably linked with it ever since. He was born in a faction, the Banu Hashim, of the ruling Quraysh tribe. It was in Mecca, in the nearby mountain cave of Hira on Jabal al-Nour, that, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad began receiving divine revelations from God through the archangel Jibreel in 610 AD. Advocating his form of Abrahamic monotheism against Meccan paganism, and after enduring persecution from the pagan tribes for 13 years, Muhammad emigrated to Medina (hijrah) in 622 with his companions, the Muhajirun, to Yathrib (later renamed Medina). The conflict between the Quraysh and the Muslims is accepted to have begun at this point. Overall, Meccan efforts to annihilate Islam failed and proved to be costly and unsuccessful.[citation needed] During the Battle of the Trench in 627, the combined armies of Arabia were unable to defeat Muhammad's forces.[71]\nIn 628, Muhammad and his followers wanted to enter Mecca for pilgrimage, but were blocked by the Quraysh. Subsequently, Muslims and Meccans entered into the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, whereby the Quraysh and their allies promised to cease fighting Muslims and their allies and promised that Muslims would be allowed into the city to perform the pilgrimage the following year. It was meant to be a ceasefire for 10 years; however, just two years later, the Banu Bakr, allies of the Quraish, violated the truce by slaughtering a group of the Banu Khuza'ah, allies of the Muslims. Muhammad and his companions, now 10,000 strong, marched into Mecca and conquered the city. The pagan imagery was destroyed by Muhammad's followers and the location Islamized and rededicated to the worship of Allah alone. Mecca was declared the holiest site in Islam ordaining it as the center of Muslim pilgrimage (Hajj), one of the faith's Five Pillars. Muhammad then returned to Medina, after assigning 'Akib ibn Usaid as governor of the city. His other activities in Arabia led to the unification of the peninsula under the banner of Islam.[59][71] Muhammad died in 632. Within the next few hundred years, the area under the banner of Islam stretched from North Africa into Asia and parts of Europe. As the Islamic realm grew, Mecca continued to attract pilgrims from all across the Muslim world and beyond, as Muslims came to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Mecca also attracted a year-round population of scholars, pious Muslims who wished to live close to the Kaaba, and local inhabitants who served the pilgrims. Due to the difficulty and expense of the Hajj, pilgrims arrived by boat at Jeddah, and came overland, or joined the annual caravans from Syria or Iraq.[citation needed]\nMecca was never the capital of any of the Islamic states. Muslim rulers did contribute to its upkeep, such as during the reigns of 'Umar (r. 634‚Äì644 CE) and 'Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644‚Äì656 CE) when concerns of flooding caused the caliphs to bring in Christian engineers to build barrages in the low-lying quarters and construct dykes and embankments to protect the area round the Kaaba.[59]\nMuhammad's return to Medina shifted the focus away from Mecca and later even further away when 'Ali, the fourth caliph, took power chose Kufa as his capital. The Umayyad Caliphate moved the capital to Damascus in Syria and the Abbasid Caliphate to Baghdad, in modern-day Iraq, which remained the center of the Islamic Empire for nearly 500 years. Mecca re-entered Islamic political history during the Second Fitna, when it was held by Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr and the Zubayrids.[citation needed] The city was twice besieged by the Umayyads, in 683 and 692 and for some time thereafter, the city figured little in politics, remaining a city of devotion and scholarship governed by various other factions. In 930, Mecca was attacked and sacked by Qarmatians, a millenarian Shi'a Isma'ili Muslim sect led by Ab≈´-TƒÅhir Al-JannƒÅbƒ´ and centered in eastern Arabia.[72] The Black Death pandemic hit Mecca in 1349.[73]\nMecca, ca. 1718 CE\nMecca, ca. 1778 CE\nMecca, in the 1880s\nMecca in 1910\nPilgrims surround the Ka'bah in 1910\nOne of the most famous travelers to Mecca in the 14th century was Moroccan scholar and traveler, Ibn Battuta. In his rihla (account), he provides a vast description of the city. Around the year 1327 CE or 729 AH, Ibn Battuta arrived at the holy city. Immediately, he says, it felt like a holy sanctuary and thus. he started the rites of the pilgrimage. He remained in Mecca for three years and left in 1330 CE. During his second year in the holy city, he says his caravan arrived \"with a great quantity of alms for the support of those who were staying in Mecca and Medina\". While in Mecca, prayers were made for (not to) the King of Iraq and also for Salaheddin al-Ayyubi, Sultan of Egypt and Syria at the Ka'bah. Battuta says the Ka'bah was large, but was destroyed and rebuilt smaller than the original and that it contained images of angels and prophets including Jesus, his mother Mary and many others. Battuta describes the Ka'bah as an important part of Mecca due to the fact that many people make the pilgrimage to it. Battuta describes the people of the city as being humble and kind, and also willing to give a part of everything they had to someone who had nothing. The inhabitants of Mecca and the village itself, he says, were very clean. There was also a sense of elegance to the village.[74]\nUnder the Ottomans\nIn 1517, the then Sharif of Mecca, Barakat bin Muhammad, acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Caliph but retained a great degree of local autonomy.[75] In 1803 the city was captured by the First Saudi State,[76] which held Mecca until 1813. destroying some of the historic tombs and domes in and around the city. The Ottomans assigned the task of bringing Mecca back under Ottoman control to their powerful Khedive (viceroy) and Wali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha. Muhammad Ali Pasha successfully returned Mecca to Ottoman control in 1813. In 1818, the Saud were defeated again but survived and founded the Second Saudi State that lasted until 1891 and led on to the present country of Saudi Arabia. In 1853, Sir Richard Francis Burton undertook the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina disguised as a Muslim. Although Burton was certainly not the first non-Muslim European to make the Hajj (Ludovico di Varthema did this in 1503),[77] his pilgrimage remains one of the most famous and documented of modern times. Mecca was regularly hit by cholera outbreaks. Between 1830 and 1930, cholera broke out among pilgrims at Mecca 27 times.[78]\nHashemite Revolt and subsequent control by the Sharifate of Mecca\nIn World War I, the Ottoman Empire was at war with the Allies. It had successfully repulsed an attack on Istanbul in the Gallipoli campaign and on Baghdad in the Siege of Kut. The British intelligence agent T.E. Lawrence conspired with the Ottoman governor, Hussain bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and it was the first city captured by his forces in the 1916 Battle of Mecca. Sharif's revolt proved a turning point of the war on the eastern front. Hussein declared a new state, the Kingdom of Hejaz, declaring himself the Sharif of the state and Mecca his capital. News reports in November 1916 via contact in Cairo with returning Hajj pilgrims, stated that with the Ottoman Turkish authorities gone, the Hajj of 1916 was free of the previous massive extortion and monetary demands made by the Turks who were agents of the Ottoman government.[79]\nSaudi Arabian conquest and modern history\nFollowing the 1924 Battle of Mecca, the Sharif of Mecca was overthrown by the Saud family, and Mecca was incorporated into Saudi Arabia.[80] Under Saudi rule, much of the historic city has been demolished as a result of the Saudi government fearing these sites might become sites of association in worship beside Allah (shirk). The city has been expanded to include several towns previously considered to be separate from the holy city and now is just a few kilometers outside the main sites of the Hajj, Mina, Muzdalifah and Arafat. Mecca is not served by any airport, due to concerns about the city's safety. It is instead served by the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah (approx. 70¬†km away) internationally and the Ta'if Regional Airport (approx. 120¬†km away) for domestic flights.[citation needed]\nThe city today is at the junction of the two most important highways in all of the Saudi Arabian highway system, Highway 40, which connects the city to Jeddah in the west and the capital, Riyadh and Dammam in the east and Highway 15, which connects it to Medina, Tabuk and onward to Jordan in the north and Abha and Jizan in the south. The Ottomans had planned to extend their railway network to the holy city, but were forced to abandon this plan due to their partaking in the First World War. This plan was later carried out by the Saudi government, which connected the two holy cities of Medina and Mecca with the modern Haramain high-speed railway system which runs at 300¬†km/h (190¬†mph) and connects the two cities via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh within two hours.[citation needed]\nThe haram area of Mecca, in which the entry of non-Muslims is forbidden, is much larger than that of Medina.\n1979 Grand Mosque seizureOn 20 November 1979, two hundred armed dissidents led by Juhayman al-Otaibi, seized the Grand Mosque, claiming the Saudi royal family no longer represented pure Islam and that the Masjid al-Haram and the Ka'bah, must be held by those of true faith. The rebels seized tens of thousands of pilgrims as hostages and barricaded themselves in the mosque. The siege lasted two weeks, and resulted in several hundred deaths and significant damage to the shrine, especially the Safa-Marwah gallery. A multinational force was finally able to retake the mosque from the dissidents.[81] Since then, the Grand Mosque has been expanded several times, with many other expansions being undertaken in the present-day.\nDestruction of Islamic heritage sitesUnder Saudi rule, it has been estimated that since 1985, about 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, have been demolished.[7][82] It has been reported that there are now fewer than 20 structures remaining in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad. Some important buildings that have been destroyed include the house of Khadijah, the wife of Muhammad, the house of Abu Bakr, Muhammad's birthplace and the Ottoman-era Ajyad Fortress.[83] The reason for much of the destruction of historic buildings has been for the construction of hotels, apartments, parking lots, and other infrastructure facilities for Hajj pilgrims.[82]\nIncidents during pilgrimageMecca has been the site of several incidents and failures of crowd control because of the large numbers of people who come to make the Hajj.[84][85][86] For example, on 2 July 1990, a pilgrimage to Mecca ended in tragedy when the ventilation system failed in a crowded pedestrian tunnel and 1,426 people were either suffocated or trampled to death in a stampede.[87] On 24 September 2015, 700 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at Mina during the stoning-the-Devil ritual at Jamarat.[88]\nMecca holds an important place in Islam and is the holiest city in all branches of the religion. The city derives its importance from the role it plays in the Hajj and 'Umrah.\nThe Masjid al-Haram is the largest mosque in the world and the most expensive single building in the entire world, valued at 100¬†billion US dollars, as of 2020.[89] It is the site of two of the most important rites of both the Hajj and of the Umrah, the circumambulation around the Ka'bah (tawaf) and the walking between the two mounts of Safa and Marwa (sa'ee). The masjid is also the site of the Zamzam Well. According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in the masjid is equal to 100,000 prayers in any other masjid around the world.[90]\nThere is a difference of opinion between Islamic scholars upon who first built the Ka'bah, some believe it was built by the angels while others believe it was built by Adam. Regardless, it was built several times before reaching its current state, the most famous of these renovations being the one by Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition). The Ka'bah is also the common direction of prayer (qibla) for all Muslims. The surface surrounding the Ka'bah on which Muslims circumambulate it is known as the Mataf.\nThe Black Stone is a stone, considered by scientists to be a meteorite or of similar origin and believed by Muslims to be of divine origin. It is set in the eastern corner of the Ka‚Äôbah and it is Sunnah to touch and kiss the stone. The area around the stone is generally always crowded and guarded by policemen to ensure the pilgrims' safety.\nThis is the stone which Abraham stood on to build the higher parts of the Ka'bah. It contains two footprints that are comparatively larger than average modern-day human feet. The stone is raised and housed in a golden hexagonal chamber beside the Ka'bah on the Mataf plate.\n\nMuslims believe that in the divine revelation to Muhammad, the Quran, Allah describes the mountains of Safa and Marwah as symbols of his divinity. Walking between the two mountains seven times, 4 times from Safa to Marwah and 3 times from Marwah interchangeably, is considered a mandatory pillar (rukn) of 'Umrah.\nThe Hajj pilgrimage, also called the greater pilgrimage, attracts millions of Muslims from all over the world and almost triples Mecca's population for one week in the twelfth and final Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah. In 2019, the Hajj attracted 2,489,406 pilgrims to the holy city.[91] The 'Umrah, or the lesser pilgrimage, can be done at anytime during the year.  Every adult, healthy Muslim who has the financial and physical capacity to travel to Mecca must perform the Hajj at least once in a lifetime. Umrah, the lesser pilgrimage, is not obligatory, but is recommended in the Quran.[92] In addition to the Masjid al-Haram, pilgrims also must visit the nearby towns of Mina/Muna, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat for various rituals that are part of the Hajj.This is a mountain believed by Muslims to have been the place where Muhammad spent his time away from the bustling city of Mecca in seclusion.[93][94] The mountain is located on the eastern entrance of the city and is the highest point in the city at 642 meters (2,106 feet).\nSituated atop Jabal an-Nur, this is the place where Muslims believe Muhammad received the first revelation from Allah through the archangel Gabriel (Jibril in Islamic tradition) at the age of 40.[93][94]\nMecca is located in the Hejaz region, a 200¬†km (124¬†mi) wide strip of mountains separating the Nafud desert from the Red Sea. The city is situated in a valley with the same name around 70¬†km (44¬†mi) west of the port city of Jeddah. Mecca is one of the lowest cities in elevation in the Hejaz region, located at an elevation of 277¬†m (909¬†ft) above sea level at 21¬∫23' north latitude and 39¬∫51' east longitude. Mecca is divided into 34 districts.\nThe city centers on the al-Haram area, which contains the Masjid al-Haram. The area around the mosque is the old city and contains the most famous district of Mecca, Ajyad. The main street that runs to al-Haram is the Ibrahim al-Khalil Street, named after Ibrahim. Traditional, historical homes built of local rock, two to three stories long are still present within the city's central area, within view of modern hotels and shopping complexes. The total area of modern Mecca is over 1,200¬†km2 (460¬†sq¬†mi).[95]\nMecca is at an elevation of 277¬†m (909¬†ft) above sea level, and approximately 70¬†km (44¬†mi) inland from the Red Sea.[62] It is one of the lowest in the Hejaz region.\nThe city center lies in a corridor between mountains, which is often called the \"Hollow of Mecca\". The area contains the valley of al-Taneem, the valley of Bakkah and the valley of Abqar.[59][96] This mountainous location has defined the contemporary expansion of the city.\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the city used a few chief sources of water. The first were local wells, such as the Zamzam Well, that produced generally brackish water. The second source was the spring of 'Ayn Zubaydah (Spring of Zubaydah). The sources of this spring are the mountains of Jabal Sa'd and Jabal KabkƒÅb, which are a few kilometers east of 'Arafah/'Arafat or about 20¬†km (12¬†mi) southeast of Mecca. Water was transported from it using underground channels. A very sporadic third source was rainfall which was stored by the people in small reservoirs or cisterns. The rainfall, scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since earliest times. According to al-Kurdƒ´, there have been 89 floods by 1965. In the last century, the most severe flood was that of 1942. Since then, dams have been built to ameliorate this problem.[96]\n\nMecca features a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen: BWh), in three different plant hardiness zones: 10, 11 and 12.[97] Like most Saudi Arabian cities, Mecca retains warm to hot temperatures even in winter, which can range from 19¬†¬∞C (66¬†¬∞F) at night to 30¬†¬∞C (86¬†¬∞F) in the afternoon, but also, very rarely, fall to zero and subzero temperatures. Summer temperatures are extremely hot and consistently break the 40¬†¬∞C (104¬†¬∞F) mark in the afternoon, dropping to 30¬†¬∞C (86¬†¬∞F) in the evening, but humidity remains relatively low, at 30‚Äì40%. Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts scattered between November and January, with heavy thunderstorms also common during the winter.The Meccan economy has been heavily dependent on the annual pilgrimage. Income generated from the Hajj, in fact, not only powers the Meccan economy but has historically had far-reaching effects on the economy of the entire Arabian Peninsula. The income was generated in a number of ways. One method was taxing the pilgrims. Taxes were especially increased during the Great Depression, and many of these taxes existed to as late as 1972. Another way the Hajj generates income is through services to pilgrims. For example, the Saudi flag carrier, Saudia, generates 12% of its income from the pilgrimage. Fares paid by pilgrims to reach Mecca by land also generate income; as do the hotels and lodging companies that house them.[96] The city takes in more than $100¬†million, while the Saudi government spends about $50¬†million on services for the Hajj. There are some industries and factories in the city, but Mecca no longer plays a major role in Saudi Arabia's economy, which is mainly based on oil exports.[100] The few industries operating in Mecca include textiles, furniture, and utensils. The majority of the economy is service-oriented.\nNevertheless, many industries have been set up in Mecca. Various types of enterprises that have existed since 1970 in the city include corrugated iron manufacturing, copper extraction, carpentry, upholstery, bakeries, farming and banking.[96] The city has grown substantially in the 20th and 21st centuries, as the convenience and affordability of jet travel has increased the number of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. Thousands of Saudis are employed year-round to oversee the Hajj and staff the hotels and shops that cater to pilgrims; these workers in turn have increased the demand for housing and services. The city is now ringed by freeways, and contains shopping malls and skyscrapers.[101]\nFormal education started to be developed in the late Ottoman period continuing slowly into Hashemite times. The first major attempt to improve the situation was made by a Jeddah merchant, Muhammad  øAlƒ´ Zaynal Ri·∏çƒÅ, who founded the Madrasat al-FalƒÅ·∏• in Mecca in 1911‚Äì12 that cost ¬£400,000.[96] The school system in Mecca has many public and private schools for both males and females. As of 2005, there were 532 public and private schools for males and another 681 public and private schools for female students.[102] The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, but some private schools founded by foreign entities such as International schools use the English language as the medium of instruction. Some of these are coeducational while other schools are not. For higher education, the city has only one university, Umm Al-Qura University, which was established in 1949 as a college and became a public university in 1981.\nHealthcare is provided by the Saudi government free-of-charge to all pilgrims. There are ten main hospitals in Mecca:[103]\nThere are also many walk-in clinics available for both residents and pilgrims. Several temporary clinics are set up during the Hajj to tend to wounded pilgrims.\nIn February 2020, Saudi Arabia temporarily banned foreigners from entering Mecca and Medina to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom.[104]\nMecca's culture has been affected by the large number of pilgrims that arrive annually, and thus boasts a rich cultural heritage. As a result of the vast numbers of pilgrims coming to the city each year, Mecca has become by far the most diverse city in the Muslim world. In contrast to the rest of Saudi Arabia, and particularly Najd, Mecca has, according to The New York Times, become \"a striking oasis of free thought and discussion and, also, of unlikely liberalism as Meccans see themselves as a bulwark against the creeping extremism that has overtaken much Islamic debate\".[9]\nAl Baik, a local fast-food chain, is very popular among pilgrims and locals alike. Until 2018, it was available only in Mecca, Medina and Jeddah, and traveling to Jeddah just to get a taste of the fried chicken was common.\nIn pre-modern Mecca, the most common sports were impromptu wrestling and foot races.[96] Football is now the most popular sport in Mecca and the kingdom, and the city hosts some of the oldest sport clubs in Saudi Arabia such as Al Wahda FC (established in 1945). King Abdulaziz Stadium is the largest stadium in Mecca with a capacity of 38,000.[105]\nMecca is very densely populated. Most long-term residents live in the Old City, the area around the Great Mosque and many work to support pilgrims, known locally as the Hajj industry. 'Iyad Madani, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Hajj, was quoted saying, \"We never stop preparing for the Hajj.\"[106]\nYear-round, pilgrims stream into the city to perform the rites of 'Umrah, and during the last weeks of eleventh Islamic month, Dhu al-Qi'dah, on average 2-4¬†million Muslims arrive in the city to take part in the rites known as Hajj.[107] Pilgrims are from varying ethnicities and backgrounds, mainly South and Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. Many of these pilgrims have remained and become residents of the city. The Burmese are an older, more established community who number roughly 250,000.[108] Adding to this, the discovery of oil in the past 50 years has brought hundreds of thousands of working immigrants.\nNon-Muslims are not permitted to enter Mecca under Saudi law,[10] and using fraudulent documents to do so may result in arrest and prosecution.[109] The prohibition extends to Ahmadis, as they are considered non-Muslims.[110] Nevertheless, many non-Muslims and Ahmadis have visited the city as these restrictions are loosely enforced. The first such recorded example of a non-Muslim entering the city is that of Ludovico di Varthema of Bologna in 1503.[111] Guru Nanak Sahib, the founder of Sikhism, visited Mecca[112] in December 1518.[113] One of the most famous was Richard Francis Burton,[114] who traveled as a Qadiriyya Sufi from Afghanistan in 1853.\nMecca Province is the only province where expatriates outnumber Saudis.[115]\nAdorning the southern facade of the Masjid al-Haram, the Abraj al-Bait Complex, which towers over the Great Mosque, is a seven-building complex with the central clock tower having a length of 601 m (1,972 feet), making it the world's fourth-tallest building. All seven buildings in the complex also form the third-largest building by floor area. \nThe Mecca Gate, known popularly as the Quran Gate, on the western entrance of the city, or from Jeddah. Located on Highway 40, it marks the boundary of the Haram area where non-Muslims are prohibited from entering. The gate was designed in 1979 by an Egyptian architect, Samir Elabd, for the architectural firm IDEA Center. The structure is that of a book, representing the Quran, sitting on a rehal, or bookrest.[116]\nThe first press was brought to Mecca in 1885 by Osman Nuri Pasha, an Ottoman WƒÅli. During the Hashemite period, it was used to print the city's official gazette, Al Qibla. The Saudi regime expanded this press into a larger operation, introducing the new Saudi official gazette of Mecca, Umm al-QurƒÅ.[96] Mecca also has its own paper owned by the city, Al Nadwa. However, other Saudi newspapers are also provided in Mecca such as the Saudi Gazette, Al Madinah, Okaz and Al Bilad, in addition to other international newspapers.\nTelecommunications in the city were emphasized early under the Saudi reign. King Abdulaziz pressed them forward as he saw them as a means of convenience and better governance. While under Hussein bin Ali, there were about 20 public telephones in the entire city; in 1936, the number jumped to 450, totaling about half the telephones in the country. During that time, telephone lines were extended to Jeddah and Ta‚Äôif, but not to the capital, Riyadh. By 1985, Mecca, like other Saudi cities, possessed modern telephone, telex, radio and television communications.[96] Many television stations serving the city area include Saudi TV1, Saudi TV2, Saudi TV Sports, Al-Ekhbariya, Arab Radio and Television Network and various cable, satellite and other specialty television providers.\nLimited radio communication was established within the Kingdom under the Hashemites. In 1929, wireless stations were set up in various towns in the region, creating a network that would become fully functional by 1932. Soon after World War II, the existing network was greatly expanded and improved. Since then, radio communication has been used extensively in directing the pilgrimage and addressing the pilgrims. This practice started in 1950, with the initiation of broadcasts on the Day of 'Arafah (9 Dhu al-Hijjah), and increased until 1957, at which time Radio Makkah became the most powerful station in the Middle East at 50¬†kW. Later, power was increased 9-fold to 450¬†kW. Music was not immediately broadcast, but gradually folk music was introduced.[96]\nThe only airport near the city is the Mecca East airport, which is not active. Mecca is primarily served by King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah for international and regional connections and Ta'if Regional Airport for regional connections. To cater the large number of Hajj pilgrims, Jeddah Airport has Hajj Terminal, specifically for use in the Hajj season, which can accommodate 47 planes simultaneously and can receive 3,800 pilgrims per hour during the Hajj season.[117]\nMecca, similar to Medina, lies at the junction of two of the most important highways in Saudi Arabia, Highway 40, connecting it to the important port city of Jeddah in the west and the capital of Riyadh and the other major port city, Dammam, in the east. The other, Highway 15, connects Mecca to the other holy Islamic city of Medina approximately 400¬†km (250¬†mi) in the north and onward to Tabuk and Jordan. While in the south, it connects Mecca to Abha and Jizan.[118][119] Mecca is served by four ring roads, and these are very crowded compared to the three ring roads of Medina.\nAl Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro\nThe Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro is a metro line in Mecca opened on 13 November 2010.[120] The 18.1-kilometer (11.2-mile) elevated metro transports pilgrims to the holy sites of 'Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina in the city to reduce congestion on the road and is only operational during the Hajj season.[121] It consists of nine stations, three in each of the aforementioned towns.\nMecca MetroThe Mecca Metro, officially known as Makkah Mass Rail Transit, is a planned four-line metro system for the city.[122] This will be in addition to[122] the Al Masha'er Al Muqaddassah Metro which carries pilgrims.\nIn 2018, a high speed intercity rail line, part of the Haramain High Speed Rail Project, named the Haramain high-speed railway line entered operation, connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina together via Jeddah, King Abdulaziz International Airport and King Abdullah Economic City in Rabigh.[123][124] The railway consists of 35 electric trains and is capable of transporting 60¬†million passengers annually. Each train can achieve speeds of up to 300¬†kmh (190¬†mph), traveling a total distance of 450¬†km (280¬†mi), reducing the travel time between the two cities to less than two hours.[125][124] It was built by a business consortium from Spain.[126]\n"

        "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Makkah ]*\n\nMakkah[a], secara resmi bernama Makkah al-Mukarramah (bahasa Arab: ŸÖŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÉÿ±ŸÖÿ©, translit.¬†Makkat al-Mukarramah, har.¬†'Makkah, Kota yang Mulia'‚Äé), adalah salah satu kota suci Islam dan ibukota Provinsi Makkah, Arab Saudi.[2] Kota ini terletak 70¬†km (43¬†mi) ke daratan dari Jeddah di Laut Merah, di sebuah lembah kecil 277¬†m (909¬†ft) di atas permukaan laut. Populasi terakhir yang tercatat berjumlah 1.578.722 jiwa pada tahun 2015.[3] Diperkirakan populasi metro pada tahun 2020 adalah 2,042 juta jiwa, membuat Makkah sebagai kota terpadat ketiga di kerajaan. Peziarah yang berdatangan berjumlah tiga kali lipat dari penduduk setempat selama ibadah Haji setiap bulan Zulhijah.\nMakkah merupakan tempat lahir dari Muhammad. Gua Hira yang terletak di atas Jabal an-Nur berada di luar kota Makkah dan gua tersebut merupakan lokasi yang umat Islam percaya bahwa al-Qur'an pertama kali diturunkan kepada Muhammad.[4][5] Mengunjungi Makkah untuk ibadah Haji merupakan kewajiban bagi umat Islam yang mampu. Masjidil Haram merupakan rumah bagi Ka'bah‚Äîdiyakini oleh umat Islam telah dibangun oleh Ibrahim dan Isma'il‚Äîyang merupakan salah satu situs suci Islam dan patokan arah salat bagi umat Islam (kiblat), yang memperkuat makna kota Makkah bagi umat Islam.[6]\nPara penguasa Muslim, baik dari dalam maupun dari sekitar wilayah tersebut telah lama mencoba untuk merebut kota Makkah dan mempertahankan kota tersebut dalam kekuasaannya. Dengan demikian, seperti halnya kebanyakan wilayah Hijaz, kota tersebut mengalami berbagai perubahan rezim yang berutang pada sejarahnya yang kaya. Kota ini akhirnya ditaklukan dalam penaklukan Hijaz oleh Saudi yang dipimpin oleh Ibnu Saud dan sekutunya pada tahun 1925. Sejak itu, Makkah terlihat ekspansi yang luar biasa dalam ukuran dan infrastruktur dengan bangunan modern yang lebih baru seperti Menara Abraj Al Bait, bangunan tertinggi keempat di dunia dan terbesar ketiga berdasarkan luas lantai yang menjulang tinggi di atas Masjidil Haram. Pemerintah Saudi juga melakukan penghancuran beberapa bangunan bersejarah dan situs arkeologi, seperti Benteng Ajyad.[7][8][9] Kalangan non-Muslim sangat dilarang untuk memasuki kota Makkah.[10][11]\nUmat Islam dari seluruh dunia mengunjungi kota Makkah, tidak hanya untuk ibadah Haji dan Umrah, tetapi juga sebagai turis untuk mengunjungi landmark wilayah tersebut, seperti Masjid Aisyah dan situs yang dikunjungi oleh jamaah Haji dan Umrah. Makkah sekarang menjadi rumah bagi dua bangunan termahal di dunia, Masjidil Haram yang senilai 100 miliar dolar AS dan kompleks Menara Abraj Al Bait yang senilai 15 miliar dolar AS.\nKota Makkah terletak sekitar 600¬†km sebelah selatan kota Madinah, kurang lebih 200¬†km sebelah timur laut kota Jeddah. Kota ini merupakan lembah sempit yang dikelilingi gunung-gunung dengan bangunan Ka'bah sebagai pusatnya. Dengan demikian, pada masa dahulu kota ini rawan banjir bila di musim hujan sebelum akhirnya pemerintah Arab Saudi memperbaiki kota ini dan merenovasi kota ini. Seperti pada umumnya kota-kota di wilayah Arab Saudi, kota ini beriklim gurun.\nPerkembangan kota Makkah tidak terlepas dari keberadaan Nabi Ismail dan Hajar sebagai penduduk pertama kota ini yang ditempatkan oleh Nabi Ibrahim atas perintah Allah.[14] Pada perkembangannya muncul orang orang Jurhum yang akhirnya tinggal di sana. Pada masa berikutnya kota ini dipimpin oleh Quraisy yang merupakan kabilah atau suku yang utama di Jazirah Arab karena memiliki hak pemeliharaan terhadap Ka'bah. Suku ini terkenal dalam bidang perdagangan bahkan pada masa itu aktivitas dagang mereka dikenal hingga Damaskus, Palestina, dan Afrika. Tokoh sebagai kepala kabilah Quraisy adalah Qussai yang dilanjutkan oleh Abdul Muthalib.\nPada tahun 571, Nabi Muhammad keturunan langsung dari Nabi Ismail serta Qussai, lahir di kota ini dan tumbuh dewasa. Pertama kali menerima wahyu dari Allah namun ajarannya ditolak kaumnya yang saat itu masih berada dalam kegelapan pemikiran (Jahiliah) sehingga berpindah ke Madinah. Setelah Madinah berkembang, akhirnya Nabi Muhammad kembali ke Makkah dalam misi membebaskan kota Makkah tanpa pertumpahan darah yang dikenal dengan (Fathul Makkah).\nPada masa selanjutnya Makkah berada di bawah administrasi Khulafaur Rasyidin yang berpusat di Madinah, serta para Khalifah yang saat itu berkuasa di Damaskus (Dinasti Ummayyah), Bagdad (Dinasti Abbasiyah), dan Istanbul (Usmaniah). Kemudian setelah hancurnya sistem kekhalifahan, kota ini dikuasai oleh Syarif Makkah yang ikut melawan pemerintah Usmaniah dan tak selang beberapa lama berhasil direbut dan disatukan dalam pemerintahan Arab Saudi oleh Abdul Aziz bin Saud yang kemudian menjadi pelayan bagi kedua kota suci Islam, Makkah dan Madinah. Gelar yang biasa disandang para penguasa yang pernah memimpin dua kota suci tersebut.\n\nSistem administrasi pemerintahan Kota Makkah, dipimpin oleh seorang wali kota (disebut amir) yang ditunjuk oleh Pemerintah Arab Saudi dan dibantu oleh majelis dewan kota yang dipilih oleh masyarakat setempat sebanyak empat belas orang. Kota Makkah juga merupakan ibu kota dari Provinsi Makkah, di mana sejak tanggal 16 Mei 2007, yang diangkat menjadi Gubernur provinsi tersebut adalah Pangeran Khalid Al Faisal.[15]\nKota Makkah dikenal sebagai kota dagang, pada masa lalu dikenal dengan jalur perdagangan antara Yaman-Mekkah-Madinah-Damsyiq (Damaskus) dengan penghasilan sekali pemberangkatan kafilah mencapai 600.000 pound. Selain dikenal kota dagang, ekonomi juga bertumpu dengan pertanian dan peternakan serta pelayanan jasa untuk jemaah haji di antaranya usaha perhotelan dan penginapan.\nSebagai pusat agama Islam selain Madinah, kota ini memiliki pusat pusat pendidikan dan pengajaran agama Islam.\nPendidikan formal telah mulai dikembangkan sejak akhir periode Usmani perlahan terus sampai kemudian pada tahun 1912, Muhammad Ali Zaynal  ø Ridha, seorang pedagang dari Jeddah, mendirikan Madrasah al-Falah di Makkah dengan biaya waktu itu ¬£400.000.[16]\nSampai pada tahun 2005, di Makkah terdapat 532 sekolah umum atau swasta untuk pria dan 681 sekolah umum atau swasta untuk siswa perempuan.[17]\nSedangkan perguruan tinggi pertama kali didirikan di kota ini adalah sekitar tahun 1949, dengan nama Kulliyyat al-Shar'√≠a, yang kemudian menjadi Fakultas Shar'iah dari Universitas King Abdul Aziz yang berada di Jeddah.[18]\nSebagai kota suci umat Islam dan tempat menunaikan ibadah haji, kota Makkah setiap tahunnya menerima kunjungan dari umat Islam dari berbagai negara, tentunya fasilitas kesehatan merupakan fasilitas pendukung utama yang menjadi perhatian khusus bagi pemerintah Arab Saudi.[18]\nMasjidilharam, kadang kala disebut juga dengan Masjid al-Haram ataupun Al-Masjid al-·∏§arƒÅm (Arab: ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±ÿßŸÖ), merupakan masjid yang terletak di Kota Makkah Al Mukharamah, yang dibangun mengelilingi Ka'bah, yang menjadi arah kiblat umat Islam dalam mengerjakan ibadah salat. Selain itu di masjid inilah salah satu rukun ibadah haji yang wajib dilakukan umat Islam yaitu tawaf, mengelilingi Ka'bah sebanyak tujuh kali.\nSebagai kota suci umat Islam, berdasarkan hukum yang berlaku di Arab Saudi, bagi non-Muslim tidak diizinkan memasuki kota Mekkah ini.[19]\nKa'bah (Arab: ÿßŸÑŸÉÿπÿ®ÿ©) merupakan sebuah bangunan yang mendekati bentuk kubus yang terletak di tengah Masjidil Haram di Kota Makkah. Bangunan ini adalah monumen suci bagi umat Islam. Dan bangunan ini yang menjadi patokan arah kiblat untuk ibadah salat, bagi umat Islam di seluruh dunia.\nZamzam (Arab: ÿ≤ŸÖÿ≤ŸÖ) merupakan nama air yang diperoleh dari sebuah sumur mata air bawah tanah yang terletak dalam kawasan Masjidilharam, sebelah tenggara Ka'bah, dengan kedalaman sekitar 42 meter. Air zamzam ini merupakan sumber air bersih utama bagi kota Makkah. Selain dikonsumsi untuk air minum, air ini juga digunakan sebagai air wudu bagi jemaah yang akan melakukan ibadah salat di Masjidilharam.\nSelain Makkah, kota atau daerah yang digunakan dalam peribadatan haji yakni Mina, Muzdalifah, dan Arafah, kemudian terdapat kota atau daerah yang digunakan para jemaah haji untuk memulai prosesinya antara lain Bir Ali atau Dzulkulaifah yang berada di luar kota Madinah sebagai patokan jemaah yang berasal dari Madinah, serta Qarnul Manazil atau Yalamlam bagi jemaah haji yang masuk dari arah Yaman.\n",

        "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Medina ]*\n\n\n\nMedina[a], officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜŸàÿ±ÿ©‚Äé, romanized:¬†al-Madinat al-Munawwarah, lit.‚Äâ'The Enlightened City'), commonly simplified as Madƒ´nah or Madinah, is the second holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Medina Province of Saudi Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782,[2] making it the fourth-most populous city in the country.[3] Located at the core of the Medina Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293¬†km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys, agricultural spaces, older dormant volcanoes and the Nafud desert.\nThe city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in Islamic tradition, the other two being Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory.[4] The original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib and it is referred to by the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab (The Confederates). It was renamed Madƒ´nat an-Nabƒ´ (City of the Prophet or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (The Enlightened City), before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in English as Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah al-Munawwarah interchangeably.[4]\nThe city is known to have existed for over 1,500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca,[5] otherwise known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), composed of the citizens of Medina, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun, collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.[6][7]\nMuch like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short existence. The region is known to have been controlled by Arabian Jewish tribes (up to the 5th century CE), the 'Aws and Khazraj (up to Muhammad's arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622‚Äì660 CE), Umayyads (660‚Äì749 CE), Abbasids (749‚Äì1254 CE), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254‚Äì1517 CE), the Ottomans (1517‚Äì1805 CE), the First Saudi State (1805‚Äì1811 CE), Muhammad Ali Pasha (1811‚Äì1840 CE), the Ottomans for a second time (1840‚Äì1918), the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca (1918‚Äì1925 CE) and finally is in the hands of the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1925‚Äìpresent CE).[4]\nIn addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi' cemetery and the Seven Mosques among others. Recently, after the Saudi conquest, the Saudis carried out a demolition of several tombs and domes in and around the region fearing these might become sites of association of others in worship beside Allah (shirk).[8]\nMedina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.\nBefore the advent of Islam, the city was known as Yathrib (pronounced¬†[ÀàjaŒ∏r…™b]; ŸäŸéÿ´Ÿíÿ±Ÿêÿ®). The word Yathrib has been recorded in ƒÄyah (verse) 13 of Surah (chapter) 33 of the Qur'an.[Quran¬†33:13] and is thus known to have been the name of the city up to the Battle of the Trench. Muhammad later forbade calling the city by this name.[9]\nSometime after the battle, the Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah (the Kind or the Good) ([ÀàtÀ§ajba]; ÿ∑ŸéŸäŸíÿ®Ÿéÿ©)[10] and Tabah (Arabic: ÿ∑Ÿéÿßÿ®Ÿéÿ©‚Äé)[11] which is of similar meaning. This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, \"Ya Taybah!\" (O Taybah!). The two names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the Kind).\nThe city has also been called Madinah in some ahadith[11]. The names al-Madƒ´nah an-Nabawiyyah (Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÖŸéÿØŸêŸäŸíŸÜŸéÿ© Ÿ±ŸÑŸÜŸéŸëÿ®ŸéŸàŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©) and Madƒ´nat un-Nabƒ´ (both meaning \"City of the Prophet\" or \"The Prophet's City\") and al-Madƒ´nat ul-Munawwarah (\"The Enlightened City\") are all derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in official documents and road signage, along with Madinah.\nMedina is known to have been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BC.[5] By the fourth century CE, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish tribes that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Qurayza, and Banu Nadir.[12] Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian Empire's domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the Persian Shah.[13]\nThe situation changed after the arrival of two new Arab tribes, the 'Aws or Banu 'Aws and the Khazraj, also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but later revolted and became independent.[14]\nToward the end of the 5th century,[15] the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.[12]\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the 'Aws and the Khazraj.[16] However, according to Scottish scholar, William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.[14]\nEarly Muslim chronicler Ibn Ishaq tells of an ancient conflict between the last Yemenite king of the Himyarite Kingdom[17] and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognised the Ka'bah as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.[18]\nEventually the Banu 'Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's Hijrah (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies[19] The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the 'Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.[20] They fought a total of four wars.[14]\nTheir last and bloodiest known battle was the Battle of Bu'ath,[14] fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad.[12] The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. He was the most respected inhabitant of the city prior to Muhammad's arrival. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of Yathrib met secretly with Muhammad in 'Aqaba, a place outside Mecca, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to the city, where Muhammad could serve a mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\nIn 622 CE (1 AH), Muhammad and an estimated 70 Meccan Muhajirun left Mecca over a period of a few months for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced the new religion of Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as the leader of the city. The natives of Yathrib who had converted to Islam of any background‚Äîpagan Arab or Jewish‚Äîwere called the Ansar (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the Zakat tax.\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, all parties in the area agreed to the Constitution of Medina, which committed all parties to mutual cooperation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement‚Äîwhether a single document originally or several‚Äîis possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.[21] In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as KitƒÅb Dimmat al-Nabi, written in the 3rd year of the Hijra (625 CE), and which gave express liberty to Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks. In return, they were to pay the jizya annually for protection by their patrons.[22][4]\nIn the year 625 CE (3 AH), Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a senior chieftain of Mecca who later converted to Islam, led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the Qurayshi army with an estimated 1,000 troops, but just as the army approached the battlefield, 300 men under 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew, dealing a severe blow to the Muslim army's morale. Muhammad continued marching with his now 700-strong force and ordered a group of 50 archers to climb a small hill, now called Jabal ar-Rummaah (The Archers' Hill) to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry and to provide protection to the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to retreat. The frontline was pushed further and further away from the archers and foreseeing the battle to  be a victory for the Muslims, the archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading the rest to not disobey their Muhammad's orders.\nSeeing that the archers were starting to descend from the hill, Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded his unit to ambush the hill and his cavalry unit pursued the descending archers were systematically slain by being caught in the plain ahead of the hill and the frontline, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill who were shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but with little to no effect. However, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Madanis (people of Medina) suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.[24]\nIn 627 CE (5 AH), Abu Sufyan led another force toward Medina. Knowing of his intentions, Muhammad asked for proposals for defending the northern flank of the city, as the east and west were protected by volcanic rocks and the south was covered with palm trees. Salman al-Farsi, a Persian Sahabi who was familiar with Sasanian war tactics recommended digging a trench to protect the city and the Prophet accepted it. The subsequent siege came to be became known as the Battle of the Trench and the Battle of the Confederates. After a month-long siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again due to the harsh winter.\nDuring the siege, Abu Sufyan contacted the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the Muslim defenders and effectively encircle the defenders. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Aws negotiated on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to appoint one of their chiefs who had converted to Islam, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason in the Book of Deutoronomy.[25] This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The French historian Robert Mantran proposes that from this point of view it was successful‚Äîfrom this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.[25]\nIn the ten years following the hijra, Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he marched on Mecca, entering it without battle in 630 CE or 8 AH. Despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca, the growing importance of Mecca in Islam, the significance of the Ka'bah as the center of the Islamic world, as the direction of prayer (Qibla), and in the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the base of operations of the early Rashidun Caliphate.[4]\nThe city is presumed to have been renamed Madinat al-Nabi (\"City of the Prophet\" in Arabic) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and the city being the site of his burial. Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the Aramaic word Medinta, which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.[26]\n\nUnder the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the reign of 'Uthman ibn al-Affan, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at some of his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE and assassinated him in his own home. Ali, the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in Iraq for being in a more strategic location. Since then, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power. Medina witnessed little to no economic growth during and after Ali's reign.[4]After al-Hasan, the son of 'Ali, ceded power to Mu'awiyah I, son of Abu Sufyan, Mu'awiyah marched into Kufa, Ali's capital, and received the allegiance of the local 'Iraqis. This is considered to be the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. Mu'awiyah's governors took special care of Medina and dug the 'Ayn az-Zarqa'a (\"Blue Spring\") spring along with a project that included the creation of underground ducts for the purposes of irrigation. Dams were built in some of the wadis and the subsequent agricultural boom led to the strengthening of the economy.\nFollowing a period of unrest during the Second Fitna in 679 CE (60 AH), Husayn ibn 'Ali was martyred at Karbala and Yazid assumed unchecked control for the next three years. In 682 CE (63 AH), Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself Caliph of Mecca and the people of Medina swore allegiance to him. This led to an eight-year-long period of economic distress for the city. In 692 CE (73 AH), the Umayyads regained power and Medina experienced its second period of huge economic growth. Trade improved and more people moved into the city. The banks of Wadi al-'Aqiq were now lush with greenery. This period of peace and prosperity coincided with the rule of 'Umar ibn Abdulaziz, who many consider to be the fifth of the Rashidun.[4]\nAbdulbasit A. Badr, in his book, Madinah, The Enlightened City: History and Landmarks, divides this period into three distinct phases:[4]\nBadr describes the period between 749 and 974 CE (132‚Äì363 AH) as a push-and-pull between peace and political turmoil, while Medina continued to pay allegiance to the Abbasids. From 974 to 1151 CE (363‚Äì546 AH), Medina was in a liaison with the Fatimids, even though the political stand between the two remained turbulent and did not exceed the normal allegiance. From 1151 CE (546 AH) onwards, Medina paid allegiance to the Zengids, and the Emir Nuruddin Zangi took care of the roads used by pilgrims and funded the fixing of the water sources and streets. When he visited Medina in 1162 CE (557 AH), he ordered the construction of a new wall that encompassed the new urban areas outside the old city wall. Zangi was succeeded by Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, who supported Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Governor of Medina, and greatly funded the growth of the city while slashing taxes paid by the pilgrims.[4] He also funded the Bedouins who lived on the routes used by pilgrims to protect them on their journeys. The later Abbasids also continued to fund the expenses of the city. While Medina was formally allied with the Abbasids during this period, they maintained closer relations with the Zengids and Ayyubids. The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2¬†m) high, dating from this period, and was flanked with towers. Of its four gates, the Bab al-Salam (\"The Gate of Peace\"), was remarked for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, the west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations.[4]\nAfter a brutal long conflict with the Abbasids, the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo took over the Egyptian governorate and effectively gained control of Medina.[4] In 1256 CE (Rajab 654 AH), Medina was threatened by lava from the Harrat Rahat volcanic region but was narrowly saved from being burnt after the lava turned northward.[4][27][28] During Mamluk reign, the Masjid an-Nabawi caught fire twice. Once in 1256 CE (654 AH), when the storage caught fire, burning the entire mosque, and the other time in 1481 CE (886 AH), when the masjid was struck by lightning. This period also coincided with an increase in scholarly activity in Medina, with scholars such as Ibn Farhun, Al-Hafiz Zain al-Din al-'Iraqi, Al Sakhawi and others settling in the city.[4] The striking iconic Green Dome also found its beginnings as a cupola built under Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun as-Salihi in 1297 CE (678 AH).[4]\nIn 1517 CE (923 AH), the first Ottoman period began with Selim I's conquest of Mamluk Egypt. This added Medina to their territory and they continued the tradition of showering Medina with money and aid. In 1532 CE (939 AH), Suleiman the Magnificent built a secure fortress around the city and constructed a strong castle armed by an Ottoman battalion to protect the city. This is also the period in which many of the Prophet's Mosque's modern features were built even though it wasn't painted green yet.[29] These suburbs also had walls and gates. The Ottoman sultans took a keen interest in the Prophet's Mosque and redesigned it over and over to suit their preferences.\nAs the Ottomans' hold over their domains broke loose, the Madanis pledged alliance to Saud bin Abdulaziz, founder of the First Saudi state in 1805 CE (1220 AH), who quickly took over the city. In 1811 CE (1226 AH), Muhammad Ali Pasha, Ottoman commander and Wali of Egypt, commanded two armies under each of his two sons to seize Medina, the first one, under the elder Towson Pasha, failed to take Medina. But the second one, a larger army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, succeeded after battling a fierce resistance movement.[4]\nAfter defeating his Saudi foes, Muhammad Ali Pasha took over governance of Medina and although he did not formally declare independence, his governance took on more of a semi-autonomous style. Muhammad's sons, Towson and Ibrahim, alternated in the governance of the city. Ibrahim renovated the city's walls and the Prophet's Mosque. He established a grand provision distribution center (taqiyya) to distribute food and alms to the needy and Medina lived a period of security and peace, In 1840 CE (1256 AH), Muhammad moved his troops out of the city and officially handed the city to the central Ottoman command.[4]\nFour years in 1844 CE (1260 AH), after Muhammad Ali Pasha's departure, Davud Pasha was given the position of governor of Medina under the Ottoman sultan. Davud was responsible for renovating the Prophet's mosque on Sultan Abdulmejid I's orders. When Abdul Hamid II assumed power, he made Medina stand out of the desert with a number of modern marvels, including a radio communication station, an power plant for the Prophet's Mosque and its immediate vicinity, a telegraph line between Medina and Istanbul, and the Hejaz railway which ran from Damascus to Medina with a planned extension to Mecca. Within one decade, the population of the city multiplied by leaps and bounds and reached 80,000. Around this time, Medina started falling prey to a new threat, the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca in the south. Medina witnessed the longest siege in its history during and after World War I.[4]\nThe Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, first attacked Medina on 6 June 1916 CE or 4 Sha'aban 1334 AH, in the middle of World War I.[4] Four days later, Husayn held Medina in a bitter 3-year siege, during which the people faced food shortages, widespread disease and mass emigration.[4] Fakhri Pasha, governor of Medina, tenaciously held on during the Siege of Medina from 10 June 1916 and refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the Armistice of Moudros, until he was arrested by his own men and the city was taken over by the Sharifate on 10 January 1919.[4][30] Husayn largely won the war due to his alliance with the British. In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly dispatched the Sacred Relics of Muhammad to the Ottoman capital, Istanbul.[31] As of 1920, the British described Medina as \"much more self-supporting than Mecca.\"[32] After the Great War, the Sharif of Mecca, Sayyid Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, the people of Medina secretly entered an agreement with Ibn Saud in 1924, and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz conquered Medina as part of the Saudi conquest of Hejaz on 5 December 1925 (19 Jumada I 1344 AH) which gave way to the whole of the Hejaz being incorporated into the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.[4]\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focused more on the expansion of the city and the demolition of former sites that violated Islamic principles and Islamic law such as the tombs at al-Baqi. Nowadays, the city mostly only holds religious significance and as such, just like Mecca, has given rise to a number of hotels surrounding the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, which unlike the Masjid Al-·∏§arƒÅm, is equipped with an underground parking. The old city's walls have been destroyed and replaced with the three ring roads that encircle Medina today, named in order of length, King Faisal Road, King Abdullah Road and King Khalid Road. Medina's ring roads generally see less traffic overall compared to the four ring roads of Mecca.\n\nAn international airport, named the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport, now serves the city and is located on Highway 340, known locally as the Old Qassim Road. The city now sits at the crossroads of two major Saudi Arabian highways, Highway 60, known as the Qassim‚ÄìMedina Highway, and Highway 15 which connects the city to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk in the north and onward, known as the Al Hijrah Highway or Al Hijrah Road, after Muhammad's journey. The old Ottoman railway system was shutdown after their departure from the region and the old railway station has now been converted into a museum. The city has recently seen another connection and mode of transport between it and Mecca, the Haramain high-speed railway line connects the two cities via King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh, King Abdulaziz International Airport and the city of Jeddah in under 3 hours.\nThough the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, the Haram area of Medina itself is much smaller than that of Mecca and Medina has recently seen an increase in the number of Muslim and Non-Muslim expatriate workers of other nationalities, most commonly South Asian peoples and people from other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded al-Masjid an-Nabawi.\n\nSaudi Arabia is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to shirk (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old.[8] Critics have described this as \"Saudi vandalism\" and claim that 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost in Medina and Mecca over the last 50 years.[33] The most famous example of this is the demolition of al-Baqi. Medina is located in the Hejaz region which is a 200¬†km (124¬†mi) wide strip between the Nafud desert and the Red Sea.[4] Located approximately 720¬†km (447¬†mi) northwest of Riyadh which is at the center of the Saudi desert, the city is 250¬†km (155¬†mi) away from the west coast of Saudi Arabia and at an elevation of approximately 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. It lies at 39¬∫36' longitude east and 24¬∫28' latitude north. It covers an area of about 589 square kilometres (227 square miles). The city has been divided into twelve (12) districts, 7 of which have been categorised as urban districts, while the other 5 have been categorised as suburban.\nLike most cities in the Hejaz region, Medina is situated at a very high elevation. Almost three times as high as Mecca, the city is situated at 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Mount Uhud is the highest peak in Medina and is 1,077 meters (3,533 feet) tall.\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains and volcanic hills. The soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly basalt, while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era.  It is surrounded by a number of famous mountains, most notably Jabal Al-Hujjaj (The Pilgrims' Mountain) to the west, Sal'aa Mountain to the north-west, Jabal al-'Ir or Caravan Mountain to the south and Mount Uhud to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the tripoint of the three valleys (wadis) of Wadi al 'Aql, Wadi al 'Aqiq, and Wadi al Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry deserted mountainous region.[4]\nUnder the K√∂ppen climate classification, Medina falls in a hot desert climate region (BWh). Summers are extremely hot and dry with daytime temperatures averaging about 43¬†¬∞C (109¬†¬∞F) with nights about 29¬†¬∞C (84¬†¬∞F). Temperatures above 45¬†¬∞C (113¬†¬∞F) are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from 12¬†¬∞C (54¬†¬∞F) at night to 25¬†¬∞C (77¬†¬∞F) in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May. In summer, the wind is north-western, while in the spring and winters, is south-western.\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of two mosques, Masjid Quba'a and al-Masjid an-Nabawi. Both of these mosques were built by Muhammad himself. Islamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times in the Quran, two examples are Surah At-Tawbah. verse 101 and Al-Hashr. verse 8. Medinan suras are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts and they are also larger in number. Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in Sahih Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik said the Prophet said: \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people.\"According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in The Prophet's Mosque equates to 1,000 prayers in any other mosque except the Masjid al-Haram[35] where one prayer equates to 100,000 prayers in any other mosque.[35] The mosque was initially just an open space for prayer with a raised and covered minbar (pulpit) built within seven months and was located beside the Prophet's rawdhah (residence, although the word literally means garden) to its side along with the houses of his wives. The mosque was expanded several times throughout history, with many of its internal features developed overtime to suit contemporary standards.\n\nThe modern Prophet's Mosque is famed for the Green Dome situated directly above the Prophet's rawdhah, which currently serves as the burial site for Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab and is used in road signage along with its signature minaret as an icon for Medina itself. The entire piazza of the mosque is shaded from the sun by 250 membrane umbrellas. \nIt is Sunnah to perform prayer at the Quba'a Mosque. According to a hadith, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad said, \"Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\"[9][35]\nand in another narration,\"Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque ‚Äì meaning the Mosque of Quba' ‚Äì and prays there, that will be equivalent to 'Umrah.\"[9]It has been recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim that Muhammad used to go to Quba'a every Saturday to offer two rak'ahs of Sunnah prayer. The mosque at Quba'a was built by Muhammad himself upon his arrival to the old city of Medina. Quba'a and the mosque has been referred in the Qur'an indirectly in Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108.\nMasjid al-Qiblatayn is another mosque historically important to Muslims. Muslims believe that Muhammad was commanded to change his direction of prayer (qibla) from praying toward Jerusalem to praying toward the Ka'bah at Mecca, as he was commanded in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 143 and 144.[36] The mosque is currently being expanded to be able to hold more than 4,000 worshippers.[37]\nThree of these historic six mosques were combined recently into the larger Masjid al-Fath with an open courtyard.[4] Sunni sources claim that there is no hadith or any other evidence to prove that Muhammad may have said something about the virtue of these mosques.\nAl-Baqi' is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of Muhammad, caliphs and scholars are known to have been buried.[4]\n\nConcerning the end of civilization in Medina, Abu Hurairah is recorded to have said that Muhammad said:[38]\"The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada'h, they will fall down on their faces dead.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 98)Sufyan ibn Abu Zuhair said Muhammad said:[38]\"Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 99)With regards to Medina's protection from plague and ad-Dajjal, the following ahadith were recorded:\n\nby Abu Bakra:[38]\"The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 103)by Abu Hurairah:\"There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 104)As of 2018, the recorded population was 2,188,138,[39] with a growth rate of 2.32%.[40] Being a destination of Muslims from around the world, Medina witnesses illegal immigration after performing Hajj or Umrah, despite the strict rules the government has enforced. However, the Central Hajj Commissioner Prince Khalid bin Faisal stated that the numbers of illegal staying visitors dropped by 29% in 2018.[41]\nAs with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion followed by the majority of the population of Medina.\nSunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali) constitute the majority, while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the Nakhawila. Outside the haram, there are significant numbers of Non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.\nSimilar to that of Mecca, Medina exhibits a cross-cultural environment, a city where people of many nationalities and cultures live together and interact with each other on a daily basis. This only helps the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. Established in 1985, the biggest publisher of Quran in the world, it employs around 1100 people and publishes 361 different publications in many languages. It is reported that more than 400,000 people from around the world visit the complex every year.[42][43] Every visitor is gifted a free copy of the Qur'an at the end of a tour of the facility.[43]\nThe Al Madinah Museum has several exhibits concerning the cultural and historical heritage of the city featuring different archaeological collections, visual galleries and rare images of the old city.[44] It is also includes the Hejaz Railway Museum. The Dar Al Madinah Museum opened in 2011 and it uncovers the history of Medina specializing in the architectural and urban heritage of the city.[45] There is no archaeology or architecture from the time of Mohammed, except what remains of a few stone defensive towers[46] The Holy Qur'an Exhibition houses rare manuscripts of the Quran, along with other exhibitions that encircle the Masjid an-Nabawi.[47] The Madinah Arts Center, founded in 2018 and operated by the MMDA's Cultural Wing, focuses on modern and contemporary arts. The center aims to enhance arts and enrich the artistic and cultural movement of society, empowering artists of all groups and ages. As of February 2020, before the implementation of social distancing measures and curfews, it held more than 13 group and solo art galleries, along with weekly workshops and discussions. The center is located in King Fahd Park, close to Quba Mosque on an area of 8,200 square meters (88,264 square feet)[48]\nIn 2018, the MMDA launched Madinah Forum of Arabic Calligraphy, an annual forum to celebrate Arabic calligraphy and renowned Arabic calligraphers. The event includes discussions about Arabic Calligraphy, and a gallery to show the work of 50 Arabic calligraphers from 10 countries.[49] The Dar al-Qalam Center for Arabic Calligraphy is located to the northwest of the Masjid an-Nabawi, just across the Hejaz Railway Museum. In April 2020, it was announced that the center was renamed the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Center for Arabic Calligraphy, and upgraded to an international hub for Arabic Calligraphers, in conjunction with the \"Year of Arabic Calligraphy\" event organized by the Ministry of Culture during the years 2020 and 2021.[50]\nOther projects launched by the MMDA Cultural Wing include the Madinah Forum of Live Sculpture held at Quba Square, with 16 sculptors from 11 countries. The forum aimed to celebrate sculpture as it is an ancient art, and to attract young artists to this form of art.[51]\nSaudi Arabia is renowned for its passion of football around the world. Medina hosts two football clubs, Al Ansar FC, and Ohod FC, with their shared home venue at Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Stadium.\nHistorically, Medina's economy was dependent on the sale of dates and other agricultural activities. As of 1920, 139 varieties of dates were being grown in the area, along with other vegetables.[52] Religious tourism plays a major part in Medina's economy, being the second holiest city in Islam, and holding many historical Islamic locations, it attracts more than 7¬†million annual visitors who come to perform Hajj during the Hajj season, and Umrah throughout the year.[53]\nMedina has two industrial areas, the larger one was established in 2003 with a total area of 10,000,000 m2, and managed by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON). It is located 50¬†km from Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport, and 200¬†km from Yanbu Commercial Port, and has 236 factories, which produce petroleum products, building materials, food products, and many other products.[54] The Knowledge Economic City (KEC) is a Saudi Arabian joint stock company founded in 2010. It focuses on real estate development and knowledge-based industries.[55] The project is under development and is expected to highly increase the number of jobs in Medina by its completion.[56]\nThe Ministry of Education is the governing body of education in the al-Madinah Province and it operates 724 and 773 public schools for boys and girls respectively throughout the province.[57] Taibah High School is one of the most notable schools in Saudi Arabia. Established in 1942, it was the second-largest school in the country at that time. Saudi ministers and government officials have graduated from this high school.[58]\nTaibah University is a public university providing higher education for the residents of the province, it has 28 colleges, of which 16 are in Medina. It offers 89 academic programs and has a strength of 69210 students as of 2020.[59] The Islamic University, established in 1961, is the oldest higher education institution in the region, with around 22000 students enrolled. It offers majors in Sharia, Qur'an, Usul ad-Din, Hadith, and the Arabic language.[60] The university offers Bachelor of Arts degrees and also Master's and Doctorate degrees.[61] The admission is open to Muslims based on scholarships programs that provide accommodation and living expenses. In 2012, the university expanded its programs by establishing the College of Science, which offers Engineering and Computer science majors.[62] Al Madinah College of Technology, which is governed by TVTC, offers a variety of degree programs including Electrical engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer Sciences and Electronic Sciences.[circular reference] Private universities at Medina include University of Prince Muqrin, the Arab Open University, and Al Rayyan Colleges.\n\nMedina is served by the Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz International Airport located off Highway 340. It handles domestic flights, while it has scheduled international services to regional destinations in the Middle East. It is the fourth-busiest airport in Saudi Arabia, handling 8,144,790 passengers in 2018.[63] The airport project was announced as the world's best by Engineering News-Record's 3rd Annual Global Best Projects Competition held on 10 September 2015.[64][65] The airport also received the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certificate in the MENA region.[66] The airport receives higher numbers of passengers during the Hajj. In 2015, the MMDA announced Darb as-Sunnah (Sunnah Path) Project, which aims to develop and transform the 3¬†km (2¬†mi) Quba'a Road connecting the Quba'a Mosque to the al-Masjid an-Nabawi to an avenue, paving the whole road for pedestrians and providing service facilities to the visitors. The project also aims to revive the Sunnah where Muhammed used to walk from his house (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) to Quba'a every Saturday afternoon.[67]\nThe city of Medina lies at the junction of two of the most important Saudi highways, Highway 60 and Highway 15. Highway 15 connects Medina to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk and Jordan in the north. Highway 60 connects the city with Yanbu, a port city on the Red Sea in the west and Al Qassim in the east. The city is served by three ring roads: King Faisal Road, a 5¬†km ring road that surrounds Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, King Abdullah Road, a 27¬†km road that surrounds most of urban Medina and King Khalid Road is the biggest ring road that surrounds the whole city and some rural areas with 60¬†km of roads.\nThe bus transport system in Medina was established in 2012 by the MMDA and is operated by SAPTCO. The newly established bus system includes 10 lines connecting different regions of the city to Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, and serves around 20,000 passengers on a daily basis.[68][69] In 2017, the MMDA launched the Madinah Sightseeing Bus service. Open top buses take passengers on sightseeing trips throughout the day with two lines and 11 destinations, including Masjid an-Nabawi, Quba'a Mosque and Masjid al-Qiblatayn and offers audio tour guidance with 8 different languages.[70] By the end of 2019, the MMDA announced its plan to expand the bus network with 15 BRT lines. The project was set to be done in 2023.[71] In 2015, the MMDA announced a three-line metro project in extension to the public transportation master plan in Medina.[72]\nThe historic Ottoman railways were shutdown and the railway stations, including the one in Medina, were converted into museums by the Saudi government. The Haramain High Speed Railway (HHR) came into operation in 2018, linking Medina and Mecca, and passes through three stations: Jeddah, King Abdul Aziz International Airport, and King Abdullah Economic City.[73] It runs along 444 kilometres (276 miles) with a speed of 300¬†km/h, and has an annual capacity of 60¬†million passengers.[74]\n",

              "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Medina ]*\n\n\n\nMedina[a], officially Al Madinah Al Munawwarah (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜŸàÿ±ÿ©‚Äé, romanized:¬†al-Madinat al-Munawwarah, lit.‚Äâ'The Enlightened City'), commonly simplified as Madƒ´nah or Madinah, is the second holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Medina Province of Saudi Arabia. The 2020 estimated population of the city is 1,488,782,[2] making it the fourth-most populous city in the country.[3] Located at the core of the Medina Province in the western reaches of the country, the city is distributed over 589 square kilometers (227 square miles), 293¬†km2 (117 sq. mi.) of which constitutes the city's urban area, while the rest is occupied by the Hejaz mountain range, empty valleys, agricultural spaces, older dormant volcanoes and the Nafud desert.\nThe city is considered to be the second-holiest of three cities in Islamic tradition, the other two being Mecca and Jerusalem. The Masjid al-Nabawi ('Prophet's Mosque') built by Muhammad in 622 CE, is of exceptional importance in Islam and is the site of burial of the last Islamic prophet. Muslims visit his rawdhah in what is known as Ziyarat at least once in their lifetime, although this is not obligatory.[4] The original name of the city before the advent of Islam was Yathrib and it is referred to by the same name in the Qur'an in Chapter 33, al-Ahzab (The Confederates). It was renamed Madƒ´nat an-Nabƒ´ (City of the Prophet or The Prophet's City) after Muhammad's death and later al-Madinah al-Munawwarah (The Enlightened City), before being simplified and shortened to its modern name, Madinah (The City), written in English as Medina. Saudi Arabian road signage uses Madinah and al-Madinah al-Munawwarah interchangeably.[4]\nThe city is known to have existed for over 1,500 years before Muhammad's migration from Mecca,[5] otherwise known as the Hijrah. Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim caliphate under Muhammad's leadership, serving as its base of operations and as the cradle of Islam, where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), composed of the citizens of Medina, known as the Ansar and those who immigrated with Muhammad, known as the Muhajirun, collectively known as the Sahaba, gained huge influence. Medina is home to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Masjid Quba'a, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn, with the masjid at Quba'a being the oldest in Islam. A larger portion of the Qur'an was revealed in Medina in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.[6][7]\nMuch like most of the Hejaz, Medina has seen numerous exchanges of power within its comparatively short existence. The region is known to have been controlled by Arabian Jewish tribes (up to the 5th century CE), the 'Aws and Khazraj (up to Muhammad's arrival), Muhammad and the Rashidun (622‚Äì660 CE), Umayyads (660‚Äì749 CE), Abbasids (749‚Äì1254 CE), the Mamluks of Egypt (1254‚Äì1517 CE), the Ottomans (1517‚Äì1805 CE), the First Saudi State (1805‚Äì1811 CE), Muhammad Ali Pasha (1811‚Äì1840 CE), the Ottomans for a second time (1840‚Äì1918), the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca (1918‚Äì1925 CE) and finally is in the hands of the modern-day Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (1925‚Äìpresent CE).[4]\nIn addition to visiting for Ziyarah, tourists come to visit the other prominent mosques and landmarks in the city that hold religious significance such as Mount Uhud, Al-Baqi' cemetery and the Seven Mosques among others. Recently, after the Saudi conquest, the Saudis carried out a demolition of several tombs and domes in and around the region fearing these might become sites of association of others in worship beside Allah (shirk).[8]\nMedina is home to several distinguished sites and landmarks, most of which are mosques and hold historic significance. These include the three aforementioned mosques, Masjid al-Fath (also known as Masjid al-Khandaq), the Seven Mosques, the Baqi' Cemetery where the graves of many famous Islamic figures are presumed to be located; directly to the southeast of the Prophet's Mosque, the Uhud mountain, site of the eponymous Battle of Uhud and the King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex where most modern Qur'anic Mus'hafs are printed.\nBefore the advent of Islam, the city was known as Yathrib (pronounced¬†[ÀàjaŒ∏r…™b]; ŸäŸéÿ´Ÿíÿ±Ÿêÿ®). The word Yathrib has been recorded in ƒÄyah (verse) 13 of Surah (chapter) 33 of the Qur'an.[Quran¬†33:13] and is thus known to have been the name of the city up to the Battle of the Trench. Muhammad later forbade calling the city by this name.[9]\nSometime after the battle, the Prophet Muhammad renamed the city Taybah (the Kind or the Good) ([ÀàtÀ§ajba]; ÿ∑ŸéŸäŸíÿ®Ÿéÿ©)[10] and Tabah (Arabic: ÿ∑Ÿéÿßÿ®Ÿéÿ©‚Äé)[11] which is of similar meaning. This name is also used to refer to the city in the popular folk song, \"Ya Taybah!\" (O Taybah!). The two names are combined in another name the city is known by, Taybat at-Tabah (the Kindest of the Kind).\nThe city has also been called Madinah in some ahadith[11]. The names al-Madƒ´nah an-Nabawiyyah (Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÖŸéÿØŸêŸäŸíŸÜŸéÿ© Ÿ±ŸÑŸÜŸéŸëÿ®ŸéŸàŸêŸäŸéŸëÿ©) and Madƒ´nat un-Nabƒ´ (both meaning \"City of the Prophet\" or \"The Prophet's City\") and al-Madƒ´nat ul-Munawwarah (\"The Enlightened City\") are all derivatives of this word. This is also the most commonly accepted modern name of the city, used in official documents and road signage, along with Madinah.\nMedina is known to have been inhabited at least 1500 years before the Hijra, or approximately the 9th century BC.[5] By the fourth century CE, Arab tribes began to encroach from Yemen, and there were three prominent Jewish tribes that inhabited the city around the time of Muhammad: the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Qurayza, and Banu Nadir.[12] Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian Empire's domination in Hejaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the Persian Shah.[13]\nThe situation changed after the arrival of two new Arab tribes, the 'Aws or Banu 'Aws and the Khazraj, also known as the Banu Khazraj. At first, these tribes were allied with the Jewish tribes who ruled the region, but later revolted and became independent.[14]\nToward the end of the 5th century,[15] the Jewish rulers lost control of the city to the two Arab tribes. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that \"by calling in outside assistance and treacherously massacring at a banquet the principal Jews\", Banu Aus and Banu Khazraj finally gained the upper hand at Medina.[12]\nMost modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the 'Aws and the Khazraj.[16] However, according to Scottish scholar, William Montgomery Watt, the clientship of the Jewish tribes is not borne out by the historical accounts of the period prior to 627, and he maintained that the Jewish populace retained a measure of political independence.[14]\nEarly Muslim chronicler Ibn Ishaq tells of an ancient conflict between the last Yemenite king of the Himyarite Kingdom[17] and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza tribe, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place.\" The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognised the Ka'bah as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honour it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.[18]\nEventually the Banu 'Aws and the Banu Khazraj became hostile to each other and by the time of Muhammad's Hijrah (emigration) to Medina in 622 CE, they had been fighting for 120 years and were sworn enemies[19] The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the 'Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.[20] They fought a total of four wars.[14]\nTheir last and bloodiest known battle was the Battle of Bu'ath,[14] fought a few years prior to the arrival of Muhammad.[12] The outcome of the battle was inconclusive, and the feud continued. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, one Khazraj chief, had refused to take part in the battle, which earned him a reputation for equity and peacefulness. He was the most respected inhabitant of the city prior to Muhammad's arrival. To solve the ongoing feud, concerned residents of Yathrib met secretly with Muhammad in 'Aqaba, a place outside Mecca, inviting him and his small group of believers to come to the city, where Muhammad could serve a mediator between the factions and his community could practice its faith freely.\nIn 622 CE (1 AH), Muhammad and an estimated 70 Meccan Muhajirun left Mecca over a period of a few months for sanctuary in Yathrib, an event that transformed the religious and political landscape of the city completely; the longstanding enmity between the Aus and Khazraj tribes was dampened as many of the two Arab tribes and some local Jews embraced the new religion of Islam. Muhammad, linked to the Khazraj through his great-grandmother, was agreed on as the leader of the city. The natives of Yathrib who had converted to Islam of any background‚Äîpagan Arab or Jewish‚Äîwere called the Ansar (\"the Patrons\" or \"the Helpers\"), while the Muslims would pay the Zakat tax.\nAccording to Ibn Ishaq, all parties in the area agreed to the Constitution of Medina, which committed all parties to mutual cooperation under the leadership of Muhammad. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern Western historians, many of whom maintain that this \"treaty\" is possibly a collage of different agreements, oral rather than written, of different dates, and that it is not clear exactly when they were made. Other scholars, however, both Western and Muslim, argue that the text of the agreement‚Äîwhether a single document originally or several‚Äîis possibly one of the oldest Islamic texts we possess.[21] In Yemenite Jewish sources, another treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as KitƒÅb Dimmat al-Nabi, written in the 3rd year of the Hijra (625 CE), and which gave express liberty to Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks. In return, they were to pay the jizya annually for protection by their patrons.[22][4]\nIn the year 625 CE (3 AH), Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, a senior chieftain of Mecca who later converted to Islam, led a Meccan force against Medina. Muhammad marched out to meet the Qurayshi army with an estimated 1,000 troops, but just as the army approached the battlefield, 300 men under 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy withdrew, dealing a severe blow to the Muslim army's morale. Muhammad continued marching with his now 700-strong force and ordered a group of 50 archers to climb a small hill, now called Jabal ar-Rummaah (The Archers' Hill) to keep an eye on the Meccan's cavalry and to provide protection to the rear of the Muslim's army. As the battle heated up, the Meccans were forced to retreat. The frontline was pushed further and further away from the archers and foreseeing the battle to  be a victory for the Muslims, the archers decided to leave their posts to pursue the retreating Meccans. A small party, however, stayed behind; pleading the rest to not disobey their Muhammad's orders.\nSeeing that the archers were starting to descend from the hill, Khalid ibn al-Walid commanded his unit to ambush the hill and his cavalry unit pursued the descending archers were systematically slain by being caught in the plain ahead of the hill and the frontline, watched upon by their desperate comrades who stayed behind up in the hill who were shooting arrows to thwart the raiders, but with little to no effect. However, the Meccans did not capitalise on their advantage by invading Medina and returned to Mecca. The Madanis (people of Medina) suffered heavy losses, and Muhammad was injured.[24]\nIn 627 CE (5 AH), Abu Sufyan led another force toward Medina. Knowing of his intentions, Muhammad asked for proposals for defending the northern flank of the city, as the east and west were protected by volcanic rocks and the south was covered with palm trees. Salman al-Farsi, a Persian Sahabi who was familiar with Sasanian war tactics recommended digging a trench to protect the city and the Prophet accepted it. The subsequent siege came to be became known as the Battle of the Trench and the Battle of the Confederates. After a month-long siege and various skirmishes, the Meccans withdrew again due to the harsh winter.\nDuring the siege, Abu Sufyan contacted the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza and formed an agreement with them, to attack the Muslim defenders and effectively encircle the defenders. It was however discovered by the Muslims and thwarted. This was in breach of the Constitution of Medina and after the Meccan withdrawal, Muhammad immediately marched against the Qurayza and laid siege to their strongholds. The Jewish forces eventually surrendered. Some members of the Aws negotiated on behalf of their old allies and Muhammad agreed to appoint one of their chiefs who had converted to Islam, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, as judge. Sa'ad judged by Jewish law that all male members of the tribe should be killed and the women and children enslaved as was the law stated in the Old Testament for treason in the Book of Deutoronomy.[25] This action was conceived of as a defensive measure to ensure that the Muslim community could be confident of its continued survival in Medina. The French historian Robert Mantran proposes that from this point of view it was successful‚Äîfrom this point on, the Muslims were no longer primarily concerned with survival but with expansion and conquest.[25]\nIn the ten years following the hijra, Medina formed the base from which Muhammad and the Muslim army attacked and were attacked, and it was from here that he marched on Mecca, entering it without battle in 630 CE or 8 AH. Despite Muhammad's tribal connection to Mecca, the growing importance of Mecca in Islam, the significance of the Ka'bah as the center of the Islamic world, as the direction of prayer (Qibla), and in the Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj), Muhammad returned to Medina, which remained for some years the most important city of Islam and the base of operations of the early Rashidun Caliphate.[4]\nThe city is presumed to have been renamed Madinat al-Nabi (\"City of the Prophet\" in Arabic) in honour of Muhammad's prophethood and the city being the site of his burial. Alternatively, Lucien Gubbay suggests the name Medina could also have been a derivative from the Aramaic word Medinta, which the Jewish inhabitants could have used for the city.[26]\n\nUnder the first three caliphs Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman, Medina was the capital of a rapidly increasing Muslim Empire. During the reign of 'Uthman ibn al-Affan, the third caliph, a party of Arabs from Egypt, disgruntled at some of his political decisions, attacked Medina in 656 CE and assassinated him in his own home. Ali, the fourth caliph, changed the capital of the caliphate from Medina to Kufa in Iraq for being in a more strategic location. Since then, Medina's importance dwindled, becoming more a place of religious importance than of political power. Medina witnessed little to no economic growth during and after Ali's reign.[4]After al-Hasan, the son of 'Ali, ceded power to Mu'awiyah I, son of Abu Sufyan, Mu'awiyah marched into Kufa, Ali's capital, and received the allegiance of the local 'Iraqis. This is considered to be the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. Mu'awiyah's governors took special care of Medina and dug the 'Ayn az-Zarqa'a (\"Blue Spring\") spring along with a project that included the creation of underground ducts for the purposes of irrigation. Dams were built in some of the wadis and the subsequent agricultural boom led to the strengthening of the economy.\nFollowing a period of unrest during the Second Fitna in 679 CE (60 AH), Husayn ibn 'Ali was martyred at Karbala and Yazid assumed unchecked control for the next three years. In 682 CE (63 AH), Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr declared himself Caliph of Mecca and the people of Medina swore allegiance to him. This led to an eight-year-long period of economic distress for the city. In 692 CE (73 AH), the Umayyads regained power and Medina experienced its second period of huge economic growth. Trade improved and more people moved into the city. The banks of Wadi al-'Aqiq were now lush with greenery. This period of peace and prosperity coincided with the rule of 'Umar ibn Abdulaziz, who many consider to be the fifth of the Rashidun.[4]\nAbdulbasit A. Badr, in his book, Madinah, The Enlightened City: History and Landmarks, divides this period into three distinct phases:[4]\nBadr describes the period between 749 and 974 CE (132‚Äì363 AH) as a push-and-pull between peace and political turmoil, while Medina continued to pay allegiance to the Abbasids. From 974 to 1151 CE (363‚Äì546 AH), Medina was in a liaison with the Fatimids, even though the political stand between the two remained turbulent and did not exceed the normal allegiance. From 1151 CE (546 AH) onwards, Medina paid allegiance to the Zengids, and the Emir Nuruddin Zangi took care of the roads used by pilgrims and funded the fixing of the water sources and streets. When he visited Medina in 1162 CE (557 AH), he ordered the construction of a new wall that encompassed the new urban areas outside the old city wall. Zangi was succeeded by Salahuddin al-Ayyubi, founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, who supported Qasim ibn Muhanna, the Governor of Medina, and greatly funded the growth of the city while slashing taxes paid by the pilgrims.[4] He also funded the Bedouins who lived on the routes used by pilgrims to protect them on their journeys. The later Abbasids also continued to fund the expenses of the city. While Medina was formally allied with the Abbasids during this period, they maintained closer relations with the Zengids and Ayyubids. The historic city formed an oval, surrounded by a strong wall, 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2¬†m) high, dating from this period, and was flanked with towers. Of its four gates, the Bab al-Salam (\"The Gate of Peace\"), was remarked for its beauty. Beyond the walls of the city, the west and south were suburbs consisting of low houses, yards, gardens and plantations.[4]\nAfter a brutal long conflict with the Abbasids, the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo took over the Egyptian governorate and effectively gained control of Medina.[4] In 1256 CE (Rajab 654 AH), Medina was threatened by lava from the Harrat Rahat volcanic region but was narrowly saved from being burnt after the lava turned northward.[4][27][28] During Mamluk reign, the Masjid an-Nabawi caught fire twice. Once in 1256 CE (654 AH), when the storage caught fire, burning the entire mosque, and the other time in 1481 CE (886 AH), when the masjid was struck by lightning. This period also coincided with an increase in scholarly activity in Medina, with scholars such as Ibn Farhun, Al-Hafiz Zain al-Din al-'Iraqi, Al Sakhawi and others settling in the city.[4] The striking iconic Green Dome also found its beginnings as a cupola built under Mamluk Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun as-Salihi in 1297 CE (678 AH).[4]\nIn 1517 CE (923 AH), the first Ottoman period began with Selim I's conquest of Mamluk Egypt. This added Medina to their territory and they continued the tradition of showering Medina with money and aid. In 1532 CE (939 AH), Suleiman the Magnificent built a secure fortress around the city and constructed a strong castle armed by an Ottoman battalion to protect the city. This is also the period in which many of the Prophet's Mosque's modern features were built even though it wasn't painted green yet.[29] These suburbs also had walls and gates. The Ottoman sultans took a keen interest in the Prophet's Mosque and redesigned it over and over to suit their preferences.\nAs the Ottomans' hold over their domains broke loose, the Madanis pledged alliance to Saud bin Abdulaziz, founder of the First Saudi state in 1805 CE (1220 AH), who quickly took over the city. In 1811 CE (1226 AH), Muhammad Ali Pasha, Ottoman commander and Wali of Egypt, commanded two armies under each of his two sons to seize Medina, the first one, under the elder Towson Pasha, failed to take Medina. But the second one, a larger army under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, succeeded after battling a fierce resistance movement.[4]\nAfter defeating his Saudi foes, Muhammad Ali Pasha took over governance of Medina and although he did not formally declare independence, his governance took on more of a semi-autonomous style. Muhammad's sons, Towson and Ibrahim, alternated in the governance of the city. Ibrahim renovated the city's walls and the Prophet's Mosque. He established a grand provision distribution center (taqiyya) to distribute food and alms to the needy and Medina lived a period of security and peace, In 1840 CE (1256 AH), Muhammad moved his troops out of the city and officially handed the city to the central Ottoman command.[4]\nFour years in 1844 CE (1260 AH), after Muhammad Ali Pasha's departure, Davud Pasha was given the position of governor of Medina under the Ottoman sultan. Davud was responsible for renovating the Prophet's mosque on Sultan Abdulmejid I's orders. When Abdul Hamid II assumed power, he made Medina stand out of the desert with a number of modern marvels, including a radio communication station, an power plant for the Prophet's Mosque and its immediate vicinity, a telegraph line between Medina and Istanbul, and the Hejaz railway which ran from Damascus to Medina with a planned extension to Mecca. Within one decade, the population of the city multiplied by leaps and bounds and reached 80,000. Around this time, Medina started falling prey to a new threat, the Hashemite Sharifate of Mecca in the south. Medina witnessed the longest siege in its history during and after World War I.[4]\nThe Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, first attacked Medina on 6 June 1916 CE or 4 Sha'aban 1334 AH, in the middle of World War I.[4] Four days later, Husayn held Medina in a bitter 3-year siege, during which the people faced food shortages, widespread disease and mass emigration.[4] Fakhri Pasha, governor of Medina, tenaciously held on during the Siege of Medina from 10 June 1916 and refused to surrender and held on another 72 days after the Armistice of Moudros, until he was arrested by his own men and the city was taken over by the Sharifate on 10 January 1919.[4][30] Husayn largely won the war due to his alliance with the British. In anticipation of the plunder and destruction to follow, Fakhri Pasha secretly dispatched the Sacred Relics of Muhammad to the Ottoman capital, Istanbul.[31] As of 1920, the British described Medina as \"much more self-supporting than Mecca.\"[32] After the Great War, the Sharif of Mecca, Sayyid Hussein bin Ali was proclaimed King of an independent Hejaz. Soon after, the people of Medina secretly entered an agreement with Ibn Saud in 1924, and his son, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz conquered Medina as part of the Saudi conquest of Hejaz on 5 December 1925 (19 Jumada I 1344 AH) which gave way to the whole of the Hejaz being incorporated into the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.[4]\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia focused more on the expansion of the city and the demolition of former sites that violated Islamic principles and Islamic law such as the tombs at al-Baqi. Nowadays, the city mostly only holds religious significance and as such, just like Mecca, has given rise to a number of hotels surrounding the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, which unlike the Masjid Al-·∏§arƒÅm, is equipped with an underground parking. The old city's walls have been destroyed and replaced with the three ring roads that encircle Medina today, named in order of length, King Faisal Road, King Abdullah Road and King Khalid Road. Medina's ring roads generally see less traffic overall compared to the four ring roads of Mecca.\n\nAn international airport, named the Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International Airport, now serves the city and is located on Highway 340, known locally as the Old Qassim Road. The city now sits at the crossroads of two major Saudi Arabian highways, Highway 60, known as the Qassim‚ÄìMedina Highway, and Highway 15 which connects the city to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk in the north and onward, known as the Al Hijrah Highway or Al Hijrah Road, after Muhammad's journey. The old Ottoman railway system was shutdown after their departure from the region and the old railway station has now been converted into a museum. The city has recently seen another connection and mode of transport between it and Mecca, the Haramain high-speed railway line connects the two cities via King Abdullah Economic City near Rabigh, King Abdulaziz International Airport and the city of Jeddah in under 3 hours.\nThough the city's sacred core of the old city is off limits to non-Muslims, the Haram area of Medina itself is much smaller than that of Mecca and Medina has recently seen an increase in the number of Muslim and Non-Muslim expatriate workers of other nationalities, most commonly South Asian peoples and people from other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Almost all of the historic city has been demolished in the Saudi era. The rebuilt city is centred on the vastly expanded al-Masjid an-Nabawi.\n\nSaudi Arabia is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to shirk (idolatry). As a consequence, under Saudi rule, Medina has suffered from considerable destruction of its physical heritage including the loss of many buildings over a thousand years old.[8] Critics have described this as \"Saudi vandalism\" and claim that 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or companions have been lost in Medina and Mecca over the last 50 years.[33] The most famous example of this is the demolition of al-Baqi. Medina is located in the Hejaz region which is a 200¬†km (124¬†mi) wide strip between the Nafud desert and the Red Sea.[4] Located approximately 720¬†km (447¬†mi) northwest of Riyadh which is at the center of the Saudi desert, the city is 250¬†km (155¬†mi) away from the west coast of Saudi Arabia and at an elevation of approximately 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. It lies at 39¬∫36' longitude east and 24¬∫28' latitude north. It covers an area of about 589 square kilometres (227 square miles). The city has been divided into twelve (12) districts, 7 of which have been categorised as urban districts, while the other 5 have been categorised as suburban.\nLike most cities in the Hejaz region, Medina is situated at a very high elevation. Almost three times as high as Mecca, the city is situated at 620 metres (2,030 feet) above sea level. Mount Uhud is the highest peak in Medina and is 1,077 meters (3,533 feet) tall.\nMedina is a desert oasis surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains and volcanic hills. The soil surrounding Medina consists of mostly basalt, while the hills, especially noticeable to the south of the city, are volcanic ash which dates to the first geological period of the Paleozoic Era.  It is surrounded by a number of famous mountains, most notably Jabal Al-Hujjaj (The Pilgrims' Mountain) to the west, Sal'aa Mountain to the north-west, Jabal al-'Ir or Caravan Mountain to the south and Mount Uhud to the north. The city is situated on a flat mountain plateau at the tripoint of the three valleys (wadis) of Wadi al 'Aql, Wadi al 'Aqiq, and Wadi al Himdh, for this reason, there are large green areas amidst a dry deserted mountainous region.[4]\nUnder the K√∂ppen climate classification, Medina falls in a hot desert climate region (BWh). Summers are extremely hot and dry with daytime temperatures averaging about 43¬†¬∞C (109¬†¬∞F) with nights about 29¬†¬∞C (84¬†¬∞F). Temperatures above 45¬†¬∞C (113¬†¬∞F) are not unusual between June and September. Winters are milder, with temperatures from 12¬†¬∞C (54¬†¬∞F) at night to 25¬†¬∞C (77¬†¬∞F) in the day. There is very little rainfall, which falls almost entirely between November and May. In summer, the wind is north-western, while in the spring and winters, is south-western.\nMedina's importance as a religious site derives from the presence of two mosques, Masjid Quba'a and al-Masjid an-Nabawi. Both of these mosques were built by Muhammad himself. Islamic scriptures emphasise the sacredness of Medina. Medina is mentioned several times in the Quran, two examples are Surah At-Tawbah. verse 101 and Al-Hashr. verse 8. Medinan suras are typically longer than their Meccan counterparts and they are also larger in number. Muhammad al-Bukhari recorded in Sahih Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik said the Prophet said: \"Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of God, the angels, and all the people.\"According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in The Prophet's Mosque equates to 1,000 prayers in any other mosque except the Masjid al-Haram[35] where one prayer equates to 100,000 prayers in any other mosque.[35] The mosque was initially just an open space for prayer with a raised and covered minbar (pulpit) built within seven months and was located beside the Prophet's rawdhah (residence, although the word literally means garden) to its side along with the houses of his wives. The mosque was expanded several times throughout history, with many of its internal features developed overtime to suit contemporary standards.\n\nThe modern Prophet's Mosque is famed for the Green Dome situated directly above the Prophet's rawdhah, which currently serves as the burial site for Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and Umar ibn al-Khattab and is used in road signage along with its signature minaret as an icon for Medina itself. The entire piazza of the mosque is shaded from the sun by 250 membrane umbrellas. \nIt is Sunnah to perform prayer at the Quba'a Mosque. According to a hadith, Sahl ibn Hunayf reported that Muhammad said, \"Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the mosque of Quba' and prays in it, he will have a reward like the Umrah pilgrimage.\"[9][35]\nand in another narration,\"Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque ‚Äì meaning the Mosque of Quba' ‚Äì and prays there, that will be equivalent to 'Umrah.\"[9]It has been recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim that Muhammad used to go to Quba'a every Saturday to offer two rak'ahs of Sunnah prayer. The mosque at Quba'a was built by Muhammad himself upon his arrival to the old city of Medina. Quba'a and the mosque has been referred in the Qur'an indirectly in Surah At-Tawbah, verse 108.\nMasjid al-Qiblatayn is another mosque historically important to Muslims. Muslims believe that Muhammad was commanded to change his direction of prayer (qibla) from praying toward Jerusalem to praying toward the Ka'bah at Mecca, as he was commanded in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 143 and 144.[36] The mosque is currently being expanded to be able to hold more than 4,000 worshippers.[37]\nThree of these historic six mosques were combined recently into the larger Masjid al-Fath with an open courtyard.[4] Sunni sources claim that there is no hadith or any other evidence to prove that Muhammad may have said something about the virtue of these mosques.\nAl-Baqi' is a significant cemetery in Medina where several family members of Muhammad, caliphs and scholars are known to have been buried.[4]\n\nConcerning the end of civilization in Medina, Abu Hurairah is recorded to have said that Muhammad said:[38]\"The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada'h, they will fall down on their faces dead.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 98)Sufyan ibn Abu Zuhair said Muhammad said:[38]\"Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. 'Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to 'Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 99)With regards to Medina's protection from plague and ad-Dajjal, the following ahadith were recorded:\n\nby Abu Bakra:[38]\"The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 103)by Abu Hurairah:\"There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.\"[38] (al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Book 30, Hadith 104)As of 2018, the recorded population was 2,188,138,[39] with a growth rate of 2.32%.[40] Being a destination of Muslims from around the world, Medina witnesses illegal immigration after performing Hajj or Umrah, despite the strict rules the government has enforced. However, the Central Hajj Commissioner Prince Khalid bin Faisal stated that the numbers of illegal staying visitors dropped by 29% in 2018.[41]\nAs with most cities in Saudi Arabia, Islam is the religion followed by the majority of the population of Medina.\nSunnis of different schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali) constitute the majority, while there is a significant Shia minority in and around Medina, such as the Nakhawila. Outside the haram, there are significant numbers of Non-Muslim migrant workers and expats.\nSimilar to that of Mecca, Medina exhibits a cross-cultural environment, a city where people of many nationalities and cultures live together and interact with each other on a daily basis. This only helps the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. Established in 1985, the biggest publisher of Quran in the world, it employs around 1100 people and publishes 361 different publications in many languages. It is reported that more than 400,000 people from around the world visit the complex every year.[42][43] Every visitor is gifted a free copy of the Qur'an at the end of a tour of the facility.[43]\nThe Al Madinah Museum has several exhibits concerning the cultural and historical heritage of the city featuring different archaeological collections, visual galleries and rare images of the old city.[44] It is also includes the Hejaz Railway Museum. The Dar Al Madinah Museum opened in 2011 and it uncovers the history of Medina specializing in the architectural and urban heritage of the city.[45] There is no archaeology or architecture from the time of Mohammed, except what remains of a few stone defensive towers[46] The Holy Qur'an Exhibition houses rare manuscripts of the Quran, along with other exhibitions that encircle the Masjid an-Nabawi.[47] The Madinah Arts Center, founded in 2018 and operated by the MMDA's Cultural Wing, focuses on modern and contemporary arts. The center aims to enhance arts and enrich the artistic and cultural movement of society, empowering artists of all groups and ages. As of February 2020, before the implementation of social distancing measures and curfews, it held more than 13 group and solo art galleries, along with weekly workshops and discussions. The center is located in King Fahd Park, close to Quba Mosque on an area of 8,200 square meters (88,264 square feet)[48]\nIn 2018, the MMDA launched Madinah Forum of Arabic Calligraphy, an annual forum to celebrate Arabic calligraphy and renowned Arabic calligraphers. The event includes discussions about Arabic Calligraphy, and a gallery to show the work of 50 Arabic calligraphers from 10 countries.[49] The Dar al-Qalam Center for Arabic Calligraphy is located to the northwest of the Masjid an-Nabawi, just across the Hejaz Railway Museum. In April 2020, it was announced that the center was renamed the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Center for Arabic Calligraphy, and upgraded to an international hub for Arabic Calligraphers, in conjunction with the \"Year of Arabic Calligraphy\" event organized by the Ministry of Culture during the years 2020 and 2021.[50]\nOther projects launched by the MMDA Cultural Wing include the Madinah Forum of Live Sculpture held at Quba Square, with 16 sculptors from 11 countries. The forum aimed to celebrate sculpture as it is an ancient art, and to attract young artists to this form of art.[51]\nSaudi Arabia is renowned for its passion of football around the world. Medina hosts two football clubs, Al Ansar FC, and Ohod FC, with their shared home venue at Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Stadium.\nHistorically, Medina's economy was dependent on the sale of dates and other agricultural activities. As of 1920, 139 varieties of dates were being grown in the area, along with other vegetables.[52] Religious tourism plays a major part in Medina's economy, being the second holiest city in Islam, and holding many historical Islamic locations, it attracts more than 7¬†million annual visitors who come to perform Hajj during the Hajj season, and Umrah throughout the year.[53]\nMedina has two industrial areas, the larger one was established in 2003 with a total area of 10,000,000 m2, and managed by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON). It is located 50¬†km from Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz International Airport, and 200¬†km from Yanbu Commercial Port, and has 236 factories, which produce petroleum products, building materials, food products, and many other products.[54] The Knowledge Economic City (KEC) is a Saudi Arabian joint stock company founded in 2010. It focuses on real estate development and knowledge-based industries.[55] The project is under development and is expected to highly increase the number of jobs in Medina by its completion.[56]\nThe Ministry of Education is the governing body of education in the al-Madinah Province and it operates 724 and 773 public schools for boys and girls respectively throughout the province.[57] Taibah High School is one of the most notable schools in Saudi Arabia. Established in 1942, it was the second-largest school in the country at that time. Saudi ministers and government officials have graduated from this high school.[58]\nTaibah University is a public university providing higher education for the residents of the province, it has 28 colleges, of which 16 are in Medina. It offers 89 academic programs and has a strength of 69210 students as of 2020.[59] The Islamic University, established in 1961, is the oldest higher education institution in the region, with around 22000 students enrolled. It offers majors in Sharia, Qur'an, Usul ad-Din, Hadith, and the Arabic language.[60] The university offers Bachelor of Arts degrees and also Master's and Doctorate degrees.[61] The admission is open to Muslims based on scholarships programs that provide accommodation and living expenses. In 2012, the university expanded its programs by establishing the College of Science, which offers Engineering and Computer science majors.[62] Al Madinah College of Technology, which is governed by TVTC, offers a variety of degree programs including Electrical engineering, Mechanical engineering, Computer Sciences and Electronic Sciences.[circular reference] Private universities at Medina include University of Prince Muqrin, the Arab Open University, and Al Rayyan Colleges.\n\nMedina is served by the Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz International Airport located off Highway 340. It handles domestic flights, while it has scheduled international services to regional destinations in the Middle East. It is the fourth-busiest airport in Saudi Arabia, handling 8,144,790 passengers in 2018.[63] The airport project was announced as the world's best by Engineering News-Record's 3rd Annual Global Best Projects Competition held on 10 September 2015.[64][65] The airport also received the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certificate in the MENA region.[66] The airport receives higher numbers of passengers during the Hajj. In 2015, the MMDA announced Darb as-Sunnah (Sunnah Path) Project, which aims to develop and transform the 3¬†km (2¬†mi) Quba'a Road connecting the Quba'a Mosque to the al-Masjid an-Nabawi to an avenue, paving the whole road for pedestrians and providing service facilities to the visitors. The project also aims to revive the Sunnah where Muhammed used to walk from his house (al-Masjid an-Nabawi) to Quba'a every Saturday afternoon.[67]\nThe city of Medina lies at the junction of two of the most important Saudi highways, Highway 60 and Highway 15. Highway 15 connects Medina to Mecca in the south and onward and Tabuk and Jordan in the north. Highway 60 connects the city with Yanbu, a port city on the Red Sea in the west and Al Qassim in the east. The city is served by three ring roads: King Faisal Road, a 5¬†km ring road that surrounds Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, King Abdullah Road, a 27¬†km road that surrounds most of urban Medina and King Khalid Road is the biggest ring road that surrounds the whole city and some rural areas with 60¬†km of roads.\nThe bus transport system in Medina was established in 2012 by the MMDA and is operated by SAPTCO. The newly established bus system includes 10 lines connecting different regions of the city to Masjid an-Nabawi and the downtown area, and serves around 20,000 passengers on a daily basis.[68][69] In 2017, the MMDA launched the Madinah Sightseeing Bus service. Open top buses take passengers on sightseeing trips throughout the day with two lines and 11 destinations, including Masjid an-Nabawi, Quba'a Mosque and Masjid al-Qiblatayn and offers audio tour guidance with 8 different languages.[70] By the end of 2019, the MMDA announced its plan to expand the bus network with 15 BRT lines. The project was set to be done in 2023.[71] In 2015, the MMDA announced a three-line metro project in extension to the public transportation master plan in Medina.[72]\nThe historic Ottoman railways were shutdown and the railway stations, including the one in Medina, were converted into museums by the Saudi government. The Haramain High Speed Railway (HHR) came into operation in 2018, linking Medina and Mecca, and passes through three stations: Jeddah, King Abdul Aziz International Airport, and King Abdullah Economic City.[73] It runs along 444 kilometres (276 miles) with a speed of 300¬†km/h, and has an annual capacity of 60¬†million passengers.[74]\n",

        "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Japan ]*\n\n\n\n\nJapan (Japanese: Êó•Êú¨, Nippon […≤ippoÍúú…¥] (listen) or Nihon […≤ihoÍúú…¥] (listen)) is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Part of the Ring of Fire, Japan spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937¬†sq¬†mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\nJapan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.48 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and his imperial court based in Heian-ky≈ç. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (sh≈çgun) and feudal lords (daimy≈ç), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-styled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. In 1937, Japan invaded China; in 1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution. Since 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet.\nJapan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and the Group of Seven. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that are ranked as the world's fourth-most powerful military. After World War II, Japan experienced high economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite stagnant growth since the Lost Decade, the country's economy remains the third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. A leader in the automotive and electronics industries, Japan has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked the second-highest country on the Human Development Index in Asia after Singapore, Japan has one of the world's highest life expectancies, though it is experiencing a decline in population. The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent animation and video game industries.\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji Êó•Êú¨ and pronounced Nippon or Nihon.[9] Before it was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (ÂÄ≠) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.[10] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps.[9] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[10] The characters Êó•Êú¨ mean \"sun origin\".[9] It is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[11]\nThe name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters Êó•Êú¨Âúã as Cipangu.[12] The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[13] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[14][15]\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000¬†BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[16] This was followed from around 14,500¬†BC (the start of the J≈çmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[17] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[18] From around 1000 BC, Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with the J≈çmon;[19] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[20] a new style of pottery,[21] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[22] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[23]\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[24] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh≈çtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592‚Äì710).[25]\nThe far-reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[26] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince ≈åama and his nephew Prince ≈åtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[27] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih≈ç Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[26] These legal reforms created the ritsury≈ç state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[27]\nThe Nara period (710‚Äì784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij≈ç-ky≈ç (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[28][29] A smallpox epidemic in 735‚Äì737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[29][30] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-ky≈ç (modern Kyoto) in 794.[29] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794‚Äì1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.[31]\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[32] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[33] After Yoritomo's death, the H≈çj≈ç clan came to power as regents for the sh≈çguns.[29] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[34] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[29] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573).[35] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy≈çs) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[36]\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[29][37] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy≈çs;[38] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period.[39] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[29]\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[40] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh≈çgun by Emperor Go-Y≈çzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[41] The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy≈çs,[42] and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868).[41][43] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[44] The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[41] The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[45]\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa.[41] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[41] The resignation of the sh≈çgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[46] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet.[47] During the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[48][49][50] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[51][47] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[52][53]\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taish≈ç democracy (1912‚Äì1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[54][55] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[55] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[53][56][57] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[58] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[53]\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945).[59] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[53][60] On December 7‚Äì8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[61] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[62] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[63] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[53] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[64][65] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[65]\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[65] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[66] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[65] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[65] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[67] On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[68] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.[69]\nJapan comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000¬†km (1900¬†mi) northeast‚Äìsouthwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[70][71] The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[72] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp≈ç Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[73] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24¬†km2 (145,937.06¬†sq¬†mi).[2] Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world at 29,751¬†km (18,486¬†mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the sixth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering 4,470,000¬†km2 (1,730,000¬†sq¬†mi).[74][75]\nBecause of its mountainous terrain, approximately 67% of Japan's land is uninhabitable.[76] The habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries.[77][78] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi).[79]\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[80] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[81] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[82] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[83] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[84] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[68]\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[85]\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[86] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Ch≈´goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[85]\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp≈ç Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[85] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[87] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[88] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1¬†¬∞C (106.0¬†¬∞F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[89] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[90]\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry≈´ky≈´ and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[91] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[92] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[93]\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[94][95] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[96]\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[97] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[98]\nAs of 2020[update], more than 22 coal-fired power plants are planned for construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.[99] Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[100] Japan is the world's fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[88] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[101] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[102] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[103]\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[104] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[105] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[104]\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[104] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[106] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[107] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[105] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[106] Elected in the 2020 Japanese prime minister election, Yoshihide Suga is Japan's prime minister.[108]\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[109] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post‚ÄìWorld War II modifications.[110] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[111] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[109] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[112]\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[104] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[113]\n1.¬†Hokkaido\n2.¬†Aomori\n3.¬†Iwate\n4.¬†Miyagi\n5.¬†Akita\n6.¬†Yamagata\n7.¬†Fukushima\n8.¬†Ibaraki\n9.¬†Tochigi\n10.¬†Gunma\n11.¬†Saitama\n12.¬†Chiba\n13.¬†Tokyo\n14.¬†Kanagawa\n15.¬†Niigata\n16.¬†Toyama\n17.¬†Ishikawa\n18.¬†Fukui\n19.¬†Yamanashi\n20.¬†Nagano\n21.¬†Gifu\n22.¬†Shizuoka\n23.¬†Aichi\n24.¬†Mie\n25.¬†Shiga\n26.¬†Kyoto\n27.¬†Osaka\n28.¬†Hy≈çgo\n29.¬†Nara\n30.¬†Wakayama\n31.¬†Tottori\n32.¬†Shimane\n33.¬†Okayama\n34.¬†Hiroshima\n35.¬†Yamaguchi\n36.¬†Tokushima\n37.¬†Kagawa\n38.¬†Ehime\n39.¬†K≈çchi\n40.¬†Fukuoka\n41.¬†Saga\n42.¬†Nagasaki\n43.¬†Kumamoto\n44.¬†≈åita\n45.¬†Miyazaki\n46.¬†Kagoshima\n47.¬†Okinawa\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[114] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[115]  It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[116] In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.[117]\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[118] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[118] Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007[119] and with India in October 2008.[120]\nJapan's relationship with South Korea had historically been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women.[121]  As of 2019[update] Japan is a major importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and other cultural products.[122][123]\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[124] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[125] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[126]\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index 2020.[127] Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.[128] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[129] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[130]\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[131] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[132] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[133][134][135]\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[136] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[137] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[138] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[139]\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry.[140][141] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence and robbery are very low in Japan.[142][143][144][145]\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP,[146] and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2019[update].[147] As of 2019[update], Japan's labor force consisted of 67 million workers.[106] Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.4 percent.[106] Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2017.[148] Japan today has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any developed nation,[149][150] with national debt at 236% relative to GDP as of 2017.[151][152]\nJapan's exports amounted to 18.5% of GDP in 2018.[153] As of 2019[update], Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.8 percent) and China (19.1 percent).[106] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts.[74] Japan's main import markets as of 2019[update] were China (23.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), and Australia (6.3 percent).[106] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[106]\nJapan ranks 29th of 190 countries in the 2019 ease of doing business index.[154] The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[155][156] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world as of 2018[update].[157] Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015‚Äì2016.[158][159]\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[106] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[160] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[161] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[162] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[163] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[164]\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[165] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[74] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[166] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[167]\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\".[74] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[74] The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world as of 2019[update].[169]\nJapan is the third largest automobile producer in the world as of 2017[update] and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.[168][170] The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces competition from South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.[171]\nJapan's service sector accounts for about 70% of its total economic output as of 2019[update].[172] Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, √ÜON, Softbank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.[173][174]\nJapan attracted 31.9¬†million international tourists in 2019.[175] For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 11th in the world in 2019.[176] The 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Japan 4th out of 141 countries, which was the highest in Asia.[177]\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks twelfth among the most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index.[178] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[179] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[180] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[181] and three Fields medalists.[182]\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 55% of the world's 2017 total.[183] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[184]\nThe Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea and China.[185] However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[186]\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[187] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib≈ç) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[188] The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[189] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[190] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[191][192] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[193]\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[194] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[195]\nSince privatization in 1987,[196] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[197]\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[74] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[198] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[199]\nAs of 2017[update], 39% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25% from coal, 23% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 1.5% from nuclear power. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[200] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[201] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[202] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[203] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[204] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[205]\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[206] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[207]\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million,[208] of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019).[209] In 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[210] The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018).[211] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[212]\nJapan's population is 98.1% ethnic Japanese as of 2016[update],[74] with small populations of foreign workers.[213] Primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people,[214] as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.[215] Zainichi Koreans,[216] Chinese,[217] Filipinos,[218] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[219] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are among the small minority groups in Japan.[220]\nJapan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world, at 84 years as of 2019[update].[221] The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates.[222] As of 2019[update] over 20 percent of the population is over 65, and this is projected to rise to one in three by 2030.[223] The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits.[223] A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless.[223][224] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 100 million by 2050.[225] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[226][227] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[228]\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[229] Upper estimates suggest that 84‚Äì96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[230] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[231] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[232] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[233]\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[234] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[235] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[236]\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[237] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were ethnically Japanese.[238] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Bah√° º√≠ Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[239]\nJapanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[240] English instruction was made mandatory in Japanese elementary schools in 2020.[241]\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[242] Few children learn these languages,[243] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[244] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[245]\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration.[246] Since the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[247] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[248] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[249] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[250]\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[251] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[252][251][253] As of 2017[update], Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.3 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.9 percent.[254] In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent.[255] Approximately 60 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[255]\nHealth care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[256] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[257]\nJapan has one of the world's highest suicide rates.[258] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[259] Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.[260]\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America.[261] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[262] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[96]\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[263] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[263] Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.[264]\nJapanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[265] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[266] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[267] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[268] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz≈ç Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[269]\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[270][271] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[272] The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[273] An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh≈çnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[274][275]\nDuring the Edo period, the ch≈çnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash≈ç revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh≈´ with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.[276] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S≈çseki and Mori ≈ågai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki, Kaf≈´ Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors¬†‚Äì Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (1994).[277]\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[278] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[279]\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[280] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[281] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[282] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[283] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[284]\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky≈çgen, kabuki, and bunraku.[285] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[286]\nIshin-denshin (‰ª•ÂøÉ‰ºùÂøÉ) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding.[287] Isagiyosa (ÊΩî„Åï) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world.[288] Hansei (ÂèçÁúÅ) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (Ë®ÄÈúä) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names.[289]\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (ÂõΩÊ∞ë„ÅÆÁ•ùÊó•„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÊ≥ïÂæã, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H≈çritsu) of 1948.[290] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[291] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh≈çwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[292]\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[293] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[294] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[295][296][297] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi.[298] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.[299]\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14‚Äì17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[300] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[301] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[302]\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[303] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[304] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[305] Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[306]\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[307] Ishir≈ç Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[308][309] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.[310][311]\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[312] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[313] Baseball is the most popular spectator sport in the country.[314] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936.[315] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has gained a wide following.[316] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[317] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[318] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[319] Golf is also popular in Japan.[320]\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship.[321][322][323] Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships.[324][325] Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series.[326] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[327]\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[328] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[329] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[330] Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[331] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[332] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[333] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[334]\n Government\n General information\n\nCoordinates: 36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / Ôªø36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / 36; 138\n\n",

              "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Japan ]*\n\n\n\n\nJapan (Japanese: Êó•Êú¨, Nippon […≤ippoÍúú…¥] (listen) or Nihon […≤ihoÍúú…¥] (listen)) is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Part of the Ring of Fire, Japan spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937¬†sq¬†mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\nJapan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.48 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and his imperial court based in Heian-ky≈ç. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (sh≈çgun) and feudal lords (daimy≈ç), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-styled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. In 1937, Japan invaded China; in 1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution. Since 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet.\nJapan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and the Group of Seven. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that are ranked as the world's fourth-most powerful military. After World War II, Japan experienced high economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite stagnant growth since the Lost Decade, the country's economy remains the third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. A leader in the automotive and electronics industries, Japan has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked the second-highest country on the Human Development Index in Asia after Singapore, Japan has one of the world's highest life expectancies, though it is experiencing a decline in population. The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent animation and video game industries.\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji Êó•Êú¨ and pronounced Nippon or Nihon.[9] Before it was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (ÂÄ≠) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.[10] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps.[9] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[10] The characters Êó•Êú¨ mean \"sun origin\".[9] It is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[11]\nThe name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters Êó•Êú¨Âúã as Cipangu.[12] The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[13] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[14][15]\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000¬†BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[16] This was followed from around 14,500¬†BC (the start of the J≈çmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[17] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[18] From around 1000 BC, Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with the J≈çmon;[19] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[20] a new style of pottery,[21] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[22] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[23]\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[24] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh≈çtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592‚Äì710).[25]\nThe far-reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[26] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince ≈åama and his nephew Prince ≈åtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[27] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih≈ç Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[26] These legal reforms created the ritsury≈ç state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[27]\nThe Nara period (710‚Äì784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij≈ç-ky≈ç (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[28][29] A smallpox epidemic in 735‚Äì737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[29][30] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-ky≈ç (modern Kyoto) in 794.[29] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794‚Äì1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.[31]\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[32] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[33] After Yoritomo's death, the H≈çj≈ç clan came to power as regents for the sh≈çguns.[29] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[34] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[29] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573).[35] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy≈çs) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[36]\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[29][37] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy≈çs;[38] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period.[39] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[29]\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[40] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh≈çgun by Emperor Go-Y≈çzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[41] The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy≈çs,[42] and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868).[41][43] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[44] The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[41] The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[45]\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa.[41] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[41] The resignation of the sh≈çgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[46] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet.[47] During the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[48][49][50] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[51][47] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[52][53]\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taish≈ç democracy (1912‚Äì1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[54][55] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[55] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[53][56][57] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[58] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[53]\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945).[59] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[53][60] On December 7‚Äì8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[61] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[62] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[63] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[53] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[64][65] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[65]\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[65] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[66] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[65] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[65] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[67] On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[68] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.[69]\nJapan comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000¬†km (1900¬†mi) northeast‚Äìsouthwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[70][71] The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[72] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp≈ç Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[73] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24¬†km2 (145,937.06¬†sq¬†mi).[2] Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world at 29,751¬†km (18,486¬†mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the sixth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering 4,470,000¬†km2 (1,730,000¬†sq¬†mi).[74][75]\nBecause of its mountainous terrain, approximately 67% of Japan's land is uninhabitable.[76] The habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries.[77][78] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi).[79]\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[80] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[81] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[82] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[83] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[84] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[68]\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[85]\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[86] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Ch≈´goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[85]\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp≈ç Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[85] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[87] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[88] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1¬†¬∞C (106.0¬†¬∞F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[89] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[90]\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry≈´ky≈´ and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[91] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[92] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[93]\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[94][95] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[96]\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[97] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[98]\nAs of 2020[update], more than 22 coal-fired power plants are planned for construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.[99] Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[100] Japan is the world's fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[88] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[101] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[102] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[103]\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[104] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[105] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[104]\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[104] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[106] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[107] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[105] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[106] Elected in the 2020 Japanese prime minister election, Yoshihide Suga is Japan's prime minister.[108]\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[109] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post‚ÄìWorld War II modifications.[110] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[111] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[109] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[112]\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[104] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[113]\n1.¬†Hokkaido\n2.¬†Aomori\n3.¬†Iwate\n4.¬†Miyagi\n5.¬†Akita\n6.¬†Yamagata\n7.¬†Fukushima\n8.¬†Ibaraki\n9.¬†Tochigi\n10.¬†Gunma\n11.¬†Saitama\n12.¬†Chiba\n13.¬†Tokyo\n14.¬†Kanagawa\n15.¬†Niigata\n16.¬†Toyama\n17.¬†Ishikawa\n18.¬†Fukui\n19.¬†Yamanashi\n20.¬†Nagano\n21.¬†Gifu\n22.¬†Shizuoka\n23.¬†Aichi\n24.¬†Mie\n25.¬†Shiga\n26.¬†Kyoto\n27.¬†Osaka\n28.¬†Hy≈çgo\n29.¬†Nara\n30.¬†Wakayama\n31.¬†Tottori\n32.¬†Shimane\n33.¬†Okayama\n34.¬†Hiroshima\n35.¬†Yamaguchi\n36.¬†Tokushima\n37.¬†Kagawa\n38.¬†Ehime\n39.¬†K≈çchi\n40.¬†Fukuoka\n41.¬†Saga\n42.¬†Nagasaki\n43.¬†Kumamoto\n44.¬†≈åita\n45.¬†Miyazaki\n46.¬†Kagoshima\n47.¬†Okinawa\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[114] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[115]  It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[116] In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.[117]\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[118] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[118] Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007[119] and with India in October 2008.[120]\nJapan's relationship with South Korea had historically been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women.[121]  As of 2019[update] Japan is a major importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and other cultural products.[122][123]\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[124] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[125] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[126]\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index 2020.[127] Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.[128] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[129] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[130]\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[131] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[132] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[133][134][135]\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[136] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[137] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[138] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[139]\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry.[140][141] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence and robbery are very low in Japan.[142][143][144][145]\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP,[146] and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2019[update].[147] As of 2019[update], Japan's labor force consisted of 67 million workers.[106] Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.4 percent.[106] Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2017.[148] Japan today has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any developed nation,[149][150] with national debt at 236% relative to GDP as of 2017.[151][152]\nJapan's exports amounted to 18.5% of GDP in 2018.[153] As of 2019[update], Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.8 percent) and China (19.1 percent).[106] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts.[74] Japan's main import markets as of 2019[update] were China (23.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), and Australia (6.3 percent).[106] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[106]\nJapan ranks 29th of 190 countries in the 2019 ease of doing business index.[154] The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[155][156] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world as of 2018[update].[157] Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015‚Äì2016.[158][159]\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[106] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[160] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[161] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[162] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[163] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[164]\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[165] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[74] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[166] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[167]\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\".[74] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[74] The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world as of 2019[update].[169]\nJapan is the third largest automobile producer in the world as of 2017[update] and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.[168][170] The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces competition from South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.[171]\nJapan's service sector accounts for about 70% of its total economic output as of 2019[update].[172] Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, √ÜON, Softbank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.[173][174]\nJapan attracted 31.9¬†million international tourists in 2019.[175] For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 11th in the world in 2019.[176] The 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Japan 4th out of 141 countries, which was the highest in Asia.[177]\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks twelfth among the most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index.[178] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[179] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[180] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[181] and three Fields medalists.[182]\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 55% of the world's 2017 total.[183] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[184]\nThe Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea and China.[185] However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[186]\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[187] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib≈ç) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[188] The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[189] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[190] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[191][192] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[193]\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[194] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[195]\nSince privatization in 1987,[196] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[197]\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[74] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[198] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[199]\nAs of 2017[update], 39% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25% from coal, 23% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 1.5% from nuclear power. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[200] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[201] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[202] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[203] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[204] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[205]\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[206] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[207]\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million,[208] of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019).[209] In 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[210] The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018).[211] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[212]\nJapan's population is 98.1% ethnic Japanese as of 2016[update],[74] with small populations of foreign workers.[213] Primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people,[214] as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.[215] Zainichi Koreans,[216] Chinese,[217] Filipinos,[218] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[219] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are among the small minority groups in Japan.[220]\nJapan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world, at 84 years as of 2019[update].[221] The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates.[222] As of 2019[update] over 20 percent of the population is over 65, and this is projected to rise to one in three by 2030.[223] The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits.[223] A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless.[223][224] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 100 million by 2050.[225] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[226][227] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[228]\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[229] Upper estimates suggest that 84‚Äì96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[230] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[231] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[232] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[233]\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[234] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[235] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[236]\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[237] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were ethnically Japanese.[238] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Bah√° º√≠ Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[239]\nJapanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[240] English instruction was made mandatory in Japanese elementary schools in 2020.[241]\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[242] Few children learn these languages,[243] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[244] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[245]\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration.[246] Since the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[247] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[248] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[249] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[250]\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[251] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[252][251][253] As of 2017[update], Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.3 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.9 percent.[254] In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent.[255] Approximately 60 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[255]\nHealth care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[256] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[257]\nJapan has one of the world's highest suicide rates.[258] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[259] Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.[260]\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America.[261] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[262] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[96]\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[263] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[263] Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.[264]\nJapanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[265] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[266] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[267] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[268] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz≈ç Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[269]\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[270][271] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[272] The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[273] An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh≈çnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[274][275]\nDuring the Edo period, the ch≈çnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash≈ç revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh≈´ with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.[276] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S≈çseki and Mori ≈ågai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki, Kaf≈´ Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors¬†‚Äì Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (1994).[277]\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[278] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[279]\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[280] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[281] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[282] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[283] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[284]\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky≈çgen, kabuki, and bunraku.[285] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[286]\nIshin-denshin (‰ª•ÂøÉ‰ºùÂøÉ) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding.[287] Isagiyosa (ÊΩî„Åï) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world.[288] Hansei (ÂèçÁúÅ) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (Ë®ÄÈúä) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names.[289]\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (ÂõΩÊ∞ë„ÅÆÁ•ùÊó•„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÊ≥ïÂæã, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H≈çritsu) of 1948.[290] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[291] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh≈çwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[292]\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[293] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[294] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[295][296][297] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi.[298] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.[299]\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14‚Äì17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[300] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[301] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[302]\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[303] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[304] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[305] Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[306]\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[307] Ishir≈ç Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[308][309] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.[310][311]\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[312] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[313] Baseball is the most popular spectator sport in the country.[314] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936.[315] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has gained a wide following.[316] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[317] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[318] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[319] Golf is also popular in Japan.[320]\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship.[321][322][323] Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships.[324][325] Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series.[326] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[327]\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[328] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[329] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[330] Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[331] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[332] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[333] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[334]\n Government\n General information\n\nCoordinates: 36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / Ôªø36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / 36; 138\n\n",

              "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Japan ]*\n\n\n\n\nJapan (Japanese: Êó•Êú¨, Nippon […≤ippoÍúú…¥] (listen) or Nihon […≤ihoÍúú…¥] (listen)) is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Part of the Ring of Fire, Japan spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937¬†sq¬†mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\nJapan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.48 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and his imperial court based in Heian-ky≈ç. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (sh≈çgun) and feudal lords (daimy≈ç), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-styled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. In 1937, Japan invaded China; in 1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution. Since 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet.\nJapan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and the Group of Seven. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that are ranked as the world's fourth-most powerful military. After World War II, Japan experienced high economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite stagnant growth since the Lost Decade, the country's economy remains the third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. A leader in the automotive and electronics industries, Japan has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked the second-highest country on the Human Development Index in Asia after Singapore, Japan has one of the world's highest life expectancies, though it is experiencing a decline in population. The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent animation and video game industries.\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji Êó•Êú¨ and pronounced Nippon or Nihon.[9] Before it was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (ÂÄ≠) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.[10] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps.[9] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[10] The characters Êó•Êú¨ mean \"sun origin\".[9] It is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[11]\nThe name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters Êó•Êú¨Âúã as Cipangu.[12] The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[13] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[14][15]\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000¬†BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[16] This was followed from around 14,500¬†BC (the start of the J≈çmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[17] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[18] From around 1000 BC, Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with the J≈çmon;[19] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[20] a new style of pottery,[21] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[22] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[23]\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[24] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh≈çtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592‚Äì710).[25]\nThe far-reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[26] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince ≈åama and his nephew Prince ≈åtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[27] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih≈ç Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[26] These legal reforms created the ritsury≈ç state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[27]\nThe Nara period (710‚Äì784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij≈ç-ky≈ç (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[28][29] A smallpox epidemic in 735‚Äì737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[29][30] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-ky≈ç (modern Kyoto) in 794.[29] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794‚Äì1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.[31]\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[32] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[33] After Yoritomo's death, the H≈çj≈ç clan came to power as regents for the sh≈çguns.[29] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[34] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[29] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573).[35] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy≈çs) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[36]\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[29][37] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy≈çs;[38] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period.[39] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[29]\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[40] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh≈çgun by Emperor Go-Y≈çzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[41] The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy≈çs,[42] and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868).[41][43] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[44] The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[41] The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[45]\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa.[41] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[41] The resignation of the sh≈çgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[46] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet.[47] During the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[48][49][50] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[51][47] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[52][53]\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taish≈ç democracy (1912‚Äì1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[54][55] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[55] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[53][56][57] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[58] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[53]\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945).[59] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[53][60] On December 7‚Äì8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[61] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[62] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[63] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[53] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[64][65] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[65]\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[65] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[66] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[65] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[65] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[67] On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[68] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.[69]\nJapan comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000¬†km (1900¬†mi) northeast‚Äìsouthwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[70][71] The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[72] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp≈ç Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[73] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24¬†km2 (145,937.06¬†sq¬†mi).[2] Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world at 29,751¬†km (18,486¬†mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the sixth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering 4,470,000¬†km2 (1,730,000¬†sq¬†mi).[74][75]\nBecause of its mountainous terrain, approximately 67% of Japan's land is uninhabitable.[76] The habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries.[77][78] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi).[79]\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[80] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[81] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[82] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[83] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[84] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[68]\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[85]\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[86] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Ch≈´goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[85]\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp≈ç Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[85] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[87] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[88] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1¬†¬∞C (106.0¬†¬∞F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[89] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[90]\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry≈´ky≈´ and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[91] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[92] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[93]\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[94][95] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[96]\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[97] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[98]\nAs of 2020[update], more than 22 coal-fired power plants are planned for construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.[99] Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[100] Japan is the world's fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[88] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[101] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[102] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[103]\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[104] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[105] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[104]\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[104] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[106] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[107] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[105] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[106] Elected in the 2020 Japanese prime minister election, Yoshihide Suga is Japan's prime minister.[108]\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[109] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post‚ÄìWorld War II modifications.[110] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[111] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[109] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[112]\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[104] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[113]\n1.¬†Hokkaido\n2.¬†Aomori\n3.¬†Iwate\n4.¬†Miyagi\n5.¬†Akita\n6.¬†Yamagata\n7.¬†Fukushima\n8.¬†Ibaraki\n9.¬†Tochigi\n10.¬†Gunma\n11.¬†Saitama\n12.¬†Chiba\n13.¬†Tokyo\n14.¬†Kanagawa\n15.¬†Niigata\n16.¬†Toyama\n17.¬†Ishikawa\n18.¬†Fukui\n19.¬†Yamanashi\n20.¬†Nagano\n21.¬†Gifu\n22.¬†Shizuoka\n23.¬†Aichi\n24.¬†Mie\n25.¬†Shiga\n26.¬†Kyoto\n27.¬†Osaka\n28.¬†Hy≈çgo\n29.¬†Nara\n30.¬†Wakayama\n31.¬†Tottori\n32.¬†Shimane\n33.¬†Okayama\n34.¬†Hiroshima\n35.¬†Yamaguchi\n36.¬†Tokushima\n37.¬†Kagawa\n38.¬†Ehime\n39.¬†K≈çchi\n40.¬†Fukuoka\n41.¬†Saga\n42.¬†Nagasaki\n43.¬†Kumamoto\n44.¬†≈åita\n45.¬†Miyazaki\n46.¬†Kagoshima\n47.¬†Okinawa\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[114] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[115]  It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[116] In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.[117]\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[118] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[118] Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007[119] and with India in October 2008.[120]\nJapan's relationship with South Korea had historically been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women.[121]  As of 2019[update] Japan is a major importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and other cultural products.[122][123]\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[124] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[125] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[126]\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index 2020.[127] Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.[128] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[129] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[130]\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[131] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[132] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[133][134][135]\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[136] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[137] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[138] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[139]\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry.[140][141] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence and robbery are very low in Japan.[142][143][144][145]\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP,[146] and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2019[update].[147] As of 2019[update], Japan's labor force consisted of 67 million workers.[106] Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.4 percent.[106] Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2017.[148] Japan today has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any developed nation,[149][150] with national debt at 236% relative to GDP as of 2017.[151][152]\nJapan's exports amounted to 18.5% of GDP in 2018.[153] As of 2019[update], Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.8 percent) and China (19.1 percent).[106] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts.[74] Japan's main import markets as of 2019[update] were China (23.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), and Australia (6.3 percent).[106] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[106]\nJapan ranks 29th of 190 countries in the 2019 ease of doing business index.[154] The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[155][156] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world as of 2018[update].[157] Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015‚Äì2016.[158][159]\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[106] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[160] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[161] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[162] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[163] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[164]\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[165] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[74] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[166] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[167]\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\".[74] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[74] The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world as of 2019[update].[169]\nJapan is the third largest automobile producer in the world as of 2017[update] and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.[168][170] The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces competition from South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.[171]\nJapan's service sector accounts for about 70% of its total economic output as of 2019[update].[172] Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, √ÜON, Softbank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.[173][174]\nJapan attracted 31.9¬†million international tourists in 2019.[175] For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 11th in the world in 2019.[176] The 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Japan 4th out of 141 countries, which was the highest in Asia.[177]\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks twelfth among the most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index.[178] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[179] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[180] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[181] and three Fields medalists.[182]\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 55% of the world's 2017 total.[183] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[184]\nThe Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea and China.[185] However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[186]\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[187] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib≈ç) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[188] The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[189] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[190] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[191][192] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[193]\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[194] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[195]\nSince privatization in 1987,[196] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[197]\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[74] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[198] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[199]\nAs of 2017[update], 39% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25% from coal, 23% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 1.5% from nuclear power. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[200] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[201] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[202] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[203] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[204] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[205]\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[206] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[207]\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million,[208] of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019).[209] In 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[210] The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018).[211] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[212]\nJapan's population is 98.1% ethnic Japanese as of 2016[update],[74] with small populations of foreign workers.[213] Primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people,[214] as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.[215] Zainichi Koreans,[216] Chinese,[217] Filipinos,[218] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[219] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are among the small minority groups in Japan.[220]\nJapan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world, at 84 years as of 2019[update].[221] The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates.[222] As of 2019[update] over 20 percent of the population is over 65, and this is projected to rise to one in three by 2030.[223] The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits.[223] A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless.[223][224] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 100 million by 2050.[225] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[226][227] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[228]\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[229] Upper estimates suggest that 84‚Äì96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[230] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[231] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[232] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[233]\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[234] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[235] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[236]\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[237] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were ethnically Japanese.[238] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Bah√° º√≠ Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[239]\nJapanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[240] English instruction was made mandatory in Japanese elementary schools in 2020.[241]\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[242] Few children learn these languages,[243] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[244] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[245]\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration.[246] Since the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[247] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[248] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[249] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[250]\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[251] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[252][251][253] As of 2017[update], Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.3 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.9 percent.[254] In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent.[255] Approximately 60 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[255]\nHealth care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[256] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[257]\nJapan has one of the world's highest suicide rates.[258] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[259] Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.[260]\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America.[261] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[262] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[96]\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[263] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[263] Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.[264]\nJapanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[265] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[266] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[267] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[268] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz≈ç Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[269]\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[270][271] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[272] The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[273] An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh≈çnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[274][275]\nDuring the Edo period, the ch≈çnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash≈ç revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh≈´ with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.[276] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S≈çseki and Mori ≈ågai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki, Kaf≈´ Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors¬†‚Äì Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (1994).[277]\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[278] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[279]\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[280] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[281] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[282] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[283] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[284]\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky≈çgen, kabuki, and bunraku.[285] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[286]\nIshin-denshin (‰ª•ÂøÉ‰ºùÂøÉ) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding.[287] Isagiyosa (ÊΩî„Åï) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world.[288] Hansei (ÂèçÁúÅ) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (Ë®ÄÈúä) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names.[289]\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (ÂõΩÊ∞ë„ÅÆÁ•ùÊó•„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÊ≥ïÂæã, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H≈çritsu) of 1948.[290] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[291] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh≈çwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[292]\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[293] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[294] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[295][296][297] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi.[298] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.[299]\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14‚Äì17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[300] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[301] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[302]\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[303] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[304] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[305] Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[306]\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[307] Ishir≈ç Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[308][309] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.[310][311]\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[312] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[313] Baseball is the most popular spectator sport in the country.[314] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936.[315] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has gained a wide following.[316] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[317] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[318] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[319] Golf is also popular in Japan.[320]\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship.[321][322][323] Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships.[324][325] Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series.[326] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[327]\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[328] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[329] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[330] Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[331] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[332] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[333] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[334]\n Government\n General information\n\nCoordinates: 36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / Ôªø36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / 36; 138\n\n",

              "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : Japan ]*\n\n\n\n\nJapan (Japanese: Êó•Êú¨, Nippon […≤ippoÍúú…¥] (listen) or Nihon […≤ihoÍúú…¥] (listen)) is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Part of the Ring of Fire, Japan spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937¬†sq¬†mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\nJapan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.48 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nJapan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and his imperial court based in Heian-ky≈ç. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (sh≈çgun) and feudal lords (daimy≈ç), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-styled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization and modernization. In 1937, Japan invaded China; in 1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new constitution. Since 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature, the National Diet.\nJapan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and the Group of Seven. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense Forces that are ranked as the world's fourth-most powerful military. After World War II, Japan experienced high economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite stagnant growth since the Lost Decade, the country's economy remains the third-largest by nominal GDP and the fourth-largest by PPP. A leader in the automotive and electronics industries, Japan has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked the second-highest country on the Human Development Index in Asia after Singapore, Japan has one of the world's highest life expectancies, though it is experiencing a decline in population. The culture of Japan is well known around the world, including its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, which encompasses prominent animation and video game industries.\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji Êó•Êú¨ and pronounced Nippon or Nihon.[9] Before it was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (ÂÄ≠) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.[10] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps.[9] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[10] The characters Êó•Êú¨ mean \"sun origin\".[9] It is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".[11]\nThe name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters Êó•Êú¨Âúã as Cipangu.[12] The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.[13] The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.[14][15]\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000¬†BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan.[16] This was followed from around 14,500¬†BC (the start of the J≈çmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.[17] Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery.[18] From around 1000 BC, Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with the J≈çmon;[19] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming,[20] a new style of pottery,[21] and metallurgy from China and Korea.[22] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.[23]\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[24] Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh≈çtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592‚Äì710).[25]\nThe far-reaching Taika Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation.[26] The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince ≈åama and his nephew Prince ≈åtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[27] These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih≈ç Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments.[26] These legal reforms created the ritsury≈ç state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.[27]\nThe Nara period (710‚Äì784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij≈ç-ky≈ç (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[28][29] A smallpox epidemic in 735‚Äì737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.[29][30] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-ky≈ç (modern Kyoto) in 794.[29] This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794‚Äì1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.[31]\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai.[32] In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura.[33] After Yoritomo's death, the H≈çj≈ç clan came to power as regents for the sh≈çguns.[29] The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333) and became popular among the samurai class.[34] The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo.[29] Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573).[35] The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy≈çs) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").[36]\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West.[29][37] Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy≈çs;[38] his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period.[39] After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.[29]\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support.[40] When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh≈çgun by Emperor Go-Y≈çzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo).[41] The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy≈çs,[42] and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868).[41][43] Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers.[44] The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki.[41] The Edo period gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.[45]\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa.[41] Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises.[41] The resignation of the sh≈çgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration).[46] Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet.[47] During the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.[48][49][50] After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin.[51][47] The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.[52][53]\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taish≈ç democracy (1912‚Äì1926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization.[54][55] World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China.[55] The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups.[53][56][57] This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later.[58] In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.[53]\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945).[59] In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan.[53][60] On December 7‚Äì8, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific.[61] Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants, with many forced into sexual slavery.[62] After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender.[63] The war cost Japan its colonies and millions of lives.[53] The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over the territories it conquered.[64][65] The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.[65]\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices.[65] The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952,[66] and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956.[65] A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world;[65] this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\".[67] On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.[68] On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.[69]\nJapan comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3000¬†km (1900¬†mi) northeast‚Äìsouthwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[70][71] The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa.[72] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp≈ç Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago.[73] As of 2019[update], Japan's territory is 377,975.24¬†km2 (145,937.06¬†sq¬†mi).[2] Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world at 29,751¬†km (18,486¬†mi). Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the sixth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world, covering 4,470,000¬†km2 (1,730,000¬†sq¬†mi).[74][75]\nBecause of its mountainous terrain, approximately 67% of Japan's land is uninhabitable.[76] The habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries.[77][78] As of 2014[update], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi).[79]\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[80] It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[81] Japan has 111 active volcanoes.[82] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century;[83] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people.[84] More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.[68]\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.[85]\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn.[86] The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Ch≈´goku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.[85]\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp≈ç Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.[85] The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.[87] According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere.[88] The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1¬†¬∞C (106.0¬†¬∞F), was recorded on July 23, 2018,[89] and repeated on August 17, 2020.[90]\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry≈´ky≈´ and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands.[91] Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[update],[92] including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander.[93]\nA large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 52 Ramsar wetland sites.[94][95] Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.[96]\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970.[97] The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.[98]\nAs of 2020[update], more than 22 coal-fired power plants are planned for construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.[99] Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.[100] Japan is the world's fifth largest emitter of carbon dioxide.[88] As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.[101] In 2020 the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050.[102] Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.[103]\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[104] Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[105] Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[104]\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament.[104] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[106] There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[107] with a secret ballot for all elected offices.[105] The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet.[106] Elected in the 2020 Japanese prime minister election, Yoshihide Suga is Japan's prime minister.[108]\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[109] Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post‚ÄìWorld War II modifications.[110] The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world.[111] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[109] Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.[112]\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature.[104] In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:[113]\n1.¬†Hokkaido\n2.¬†Aomori\n3.¬†Iwate\n4.¬†Miyagi\n5.¬†Akita\n6.¬†Yamagata\n7.¬†Fukushima\n8.¬†Ibaraki\n9.¬†Tochigi\n10.¬†Gunma\n11.¬†Saitama\n12.¬†Chiba\n13.¬†Tokyo\n14.¬†Kanagawa\n15.¬†Niigata\n16.¬†Toyama\n17.¬†Ishikawa\n18.¬†Fukui\n19.¬†Yamanashi\n20.¬†Nagano\n21.¬†Gifu\n22.¬†Shizuoka\n23.¬†Aichi\n24.¬†Mie\n25.¬†Shiga\n26.¬†Kyoto\n27.¬†Osaka\n28.¬†Hy≈çgo\n29.¬†Nara\n30.¬†Wakayama\n31.¬†Tottori\n32.¬†Shimane\n33.¬†Okayama\n34.¬†Hiroshima\n35.¬†Yamaguchi\n36.¬†Tokushima\n37.¬†Kagawa\n38.¬†Ehime\n39.¬†K≈çchi\n40.¬†Fukuoka\n41.¬†Saga\n42.¬†Nagasaki\n43.¬†Kumamoto\n44.¬†≈åita\n45.¬†Miyazaki\n46.¬†Kagoshima\n47.¬†Okinawa\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 nations seeking reform of the Security Council.[114] Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit.[115]  It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014.[116] In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.[117]\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance.[118] The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan.[118] Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007[119] and with India in October 2008.[120]\nJapan's relationship with South Korea had historically been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women.[121]  As of 2019[update] Japan is a major importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and other cultural products.[122][123]\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945.[124] South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan.[125] Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.[126]\nJapan is the second-highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index 2020.[127] Japan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world.[128] The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes.[129] The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.[130]\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines.[131] In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security.[132] Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.[133][134][135]\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency.[136] As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission.[137] The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.[138] The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.[139]\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry.[140][141] According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[update], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence and robbery are very low in Japan.[142][143][144][145]\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP,[146] and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity as of 2019[update].[147] As of 2019[update], Japan's labor force consisted of 67 million workers.[106] Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.4 percent.[106] Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2017.[148] Japan today has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP of any developed nation,[149][150] with national debt at 236% relative to GDP as of 2017.[151][152]\nJapan's exports amounted to 18.5% of GDP in 2018.[153] As of 2019[update], Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.8 percent) and China (19.1 percent).[106] Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts.[74] Japan's main import markets as of 2019[update] were China (23.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), and Australia (6.3 percent).[106] Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials for its industries.[106]\nJapan ranks 29th of 190 countries in the 2019 ease of doing business index.[154] The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment.[155][156] Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world as of 2018[update].[157] Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015‚Äì2016.[158][159]\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the total country's GDP as of 2018[update].[106] Only 11.5% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation.[160] Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas.[161] This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[update].[162] Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected.[163] There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.[164]\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade.[165] Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch,[74] prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna.[166] Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.[167]\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\".[74] Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP.[74] The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world as of 2019[update].[169]\nJapan is the third largest automobile producer in the world as of 2017[update] and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.[168][170] The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces competition from South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.[171]\nJapan's service sector accounts for about 70% of its total economic output as of 2019[update].[172] Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, √ÜON, Softbank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.[173][174]\nJapan attracted 31.9¬†million international tourists in 2019.[175] For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 11th in the world in 2019.[176] The 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report ranked Japan 4th out of 141 countries, which was the highest in Asia.[177]\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks twelfth among the most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index.[178] Relative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the second highest in the world,[179] with 867,000 researchers sharing a 19-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2017[update].[180] The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine,[181] and three Fields medalists.[182]\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 55% of the world's 2017 total.[183] Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees.[184]\nThe Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea and China.[185] However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. In 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.[186]\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites.[187] It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib≈ç) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008.[188] The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015.[189] Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base and landing astronauts by 2030.[190] In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007,[191][192] and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.[193]\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure.[194] The country has approximately 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,000,000 kilometers (620,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 130,000 kilometers (81,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 54,736 kilometers (34,011 miles) of general national highways and 7641 kilometers (4748 miles) of national expressways as of 2017[update].[195]\nSince privatization in 1987,[196] dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.[197]\nThere are 175 airports in Japan as of 2013[update].[74] The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019.[198] The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22 million TEU respectively as of 2017[update].[199]\nAs of 2017[update], 39% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25% from coal, 23% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 1.5% from nuclear power. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010.[200] By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service.[201] The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015,[202] and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted.[203] Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy.[204] The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.[205]\nResponsibility for the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment, in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities.[206] Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. About 98% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities.[207]\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million,[208] of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019).[209] In 2019, 92% of the total Japanese population lived in cities.[210] The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018).[211] It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[212]\nJapan's population is 98.1% ethnic Japanese as of 2016[update],[74] with small populations of foreign workers.[213] Primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people,[214] as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.[215] Zainichi Koreans,[216] Chinese,[217] Filipinos,[218] Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[219] and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are among the small minority groups in Japan.[220]\nJapan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world, at 84 years as of 2019[update].[221] The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates.[222] As of 2019[update] over 20 percent of the population is over 65, and this is projected to rise to one in three by 2030.[223] The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits.[223] A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless.[223][224] Japan's population is expected to drop to around 100 million by 2050.[225] Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population.[226][227] On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.[228]\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom.[229] Upper estimates suggest that 84‚Äì96 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion.[230] However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual.[231] The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year.[232] Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.[233]\nChristianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, 1%[234] to 1.5% of the population are Christians.[235] Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.[236]\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[update].[237] As of 2018[update] there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were ethnically Japanese.[238] Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Bah√° º√≠ Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.[239]\nJapanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[240] English instruction was made mandatory in Japanese elementary schools in 2020.[241]\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.[242] Few children learn these languages,[243] but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages.[244] The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[update].[245]\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration.[246] Since the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years.[247] Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school.[248] The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University.[249] Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.[250]\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world.[251] Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[252][251][253] As of 2017[update], Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.3 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.9 percent.[254] In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent.[255] Approximately 60 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.[255]\nHealth care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments.[256] Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.[257]\nJapan has one of the world's highest suicide rates.[258] Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men.[259] Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.[260]\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America.[261] Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures.[262] Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.[96]\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas.[263] The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.[263] Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.[264]\nJapanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs.[265] The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.[266] Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.[267] Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design.[268] It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz≈ç Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.[269]\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.[270][271] In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed.[272] The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative.[273] An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh≈çnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.[274][275]\nDuring the Edo period, the ch≈çnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash≈ç revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh≈´ with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi.[276] The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S≈çseki and Mori ≈ågai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ry≈´nosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki, Kaf≈´ Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors¬†‚Äì Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe (1994).[277]\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society.[278] Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.[279]\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century.[280] Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture.[281] Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in postwar Japan and became very popular in North America.[282] Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop.[283] Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.[284]\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky≈çgen, kabuki, and bunraku.[285] Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.[286]\nIshin-denshin (‰ª•ÂøÉ‰ºùÂøÉ) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding.[287] Isagiyosa (ÊΩî„Åï) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world.[288] Hansei (ÂèçÁúÅ) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (Ë®ÄÈúä) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names.[289]\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (ÂõΩÊ∞ë„ÅÆÁ•ùÊó•„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÊ≥ïÂæã, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H≈çritsu) of 1948.[290] Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend.[291] The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh≈çwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.[292]\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients.[293] Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples.[294] Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi.[295][296][297] Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi.[298] Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.[299]\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14‚Äì17% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice.[300] Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century.[301] Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.[302]\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.[303] Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally;[304] other popular shows are in the genres of variety shows, comedy, and news programs.[305] Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[update].[306]\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally.[307] Ishir≈ç Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history.[308][309] Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.[310][311]\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport.[312] Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum.[313] Baseball is the most popular spectator sport in the country.[314] Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936.[315] Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has gained a wide following.[316] The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea.[317] Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times,[318] and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011.[319] Golf is also popular in Japan.[320]\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship.[321][322][323] Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships.[324][325] Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series.[326] The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.[327]\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998.[328] The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship[329] and will co-host the 2023 Basketball World Championship.[330] Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice.[331] The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation.[332] Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country[333] and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.[334]\n Government\n General information\n\nCoordinates: 36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / Ôªø36¬∞N 138¬∞EÔªø / 36; 138\n\n",

        "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : South Africa ]*\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. With over 59¬†million people, it is the world's 23rd-most populous nation and covers an area of 1,221,037 square kilometres (471,445 square miles). South Africa has three capital cities: executive Pretoria, judicial Bloemfontein and legislative Cape Town. The largest city is Johannesburg. About 80% of South Africans are of Black African ancestry,[9] divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages.[13] The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (White South Africans), Asian (Indian South Africans), and Multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry.\nIt is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres (1,739¬†mi) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans;[14][15][13] to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini (former Swaziland); and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho.[16] It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World, and the most populous country located entirely south of the equator. South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot, with a diversity of unique biomes and plant and animal life.\nSouth Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages, and religions. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, the fourth-highest number in the world.[13] According to the 2011 census, the two most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%) and Xhosa (16.0%).[9] The two next ones are of European origin: Afrikaans (13.5%) developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most Coloured and White South Africans; English (9.6%) reflects the legacy of British colonialism, and is commonly used in public and commercial life. The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'√©tat, and regular elections have been held for almost a century. However, the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994.\nDuring the 20th century, the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority, which played a large role in the country's recent history and politics. The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, institutionalising previous racial segregation. After a long and sometimes violent struggle by the African National Congress (ANC) and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s. Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's liberal democracy, which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces. South Africa is often referred to as the \"rainbow nation\" to describe the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid.[17]\nSouth Africa is a developing country and ranks at 114th on the Human Development Index, the seventh-highest in Africa. It has been classified by the World Bank as a newly industrialised country, with the second-largest economy in Africa, and the 33rd-largest in the world.[18][19] South Africa also has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. The country is a middle power in international affairs; it maintains significant regional influence and is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and G20.[20][21] However, crime, poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about a quarter of the population unemployed and living on less than US$1.25 a day.[22][23] Moreover, climate change is an important issue for South Africa: it is a major contributor to climate change as the 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases as of 2018 (in large part due to its coal industry),[24] and is vulnerable to many of its impacts, because of its water-insecure environment and vulnerable communities.\nThe name \"South Africa\" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation, the country was named the Union of South Africa in English and Unie van Zuid-Afrika in Dutch, reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate British colonies. Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the \"Republic of South Africa\" and Republiek van Suid-Afrika in Afrikaans. Since 1994, the country has had an official name in each of its 11 official languages.\nMzansi, derived from the Xhosa noun uMzantsi meaning \"south\", is a colloquial name for South Africa,[25][26] while some Pan-Africanist political parties prefer the term \"Azania\".[27]\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world.[28][29][30] Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province. The area, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has been branded \"the Cradle of Humankind\". The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world. Other sites include Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Coopers Cave and Malapa. Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924. Further hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province, Cornelia and Florisbad in the Free State Province, Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province, Klasies River Mouth in Eastern Cape Province and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province.\nThese finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago, starting with Australopithecus africanus.[31] There followed species including Australopithecus sediba, Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo rhodesiensis, Homo helmei, Homo naledi and modern humans (Homo sapiens). Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for at least 170,000 years.\nVarious researchers have located pebble tools within the Vaal River valley.[32][33]\nSettlements of Bantu-speaking peoples, who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the Limpopo River (now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe) by the 4th or 5th century CE (see Bantu expansion). They displaced, conquered and absorbed the original Khoisan speakers, the Khoikhoi and San peoples. The Bantu slowly moved south. The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples.\nIn Mpumalanga Province, several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named Adam's Calendar, and the ruins are thought to be created by the Bakone, a Northern Sotho people.[34][35]\nAt the time of European contact, the dominant ethnic group were Bantu-speaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of Africa about one thousand years before. The two major historic groups were the Xhosa and Zulu peoples.\nIn 1487, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa.[36] On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as Walvis Bay in present-day Namibia). This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator Diogo C√£o (Cape Cross, north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, Rio do Infante, probably the present-day Groot River, in May 1488, but on his return he saw the Cape, which he first named Cabo das Tormentas ('Cape of Storms'). His King, John II, renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperan√ßa, or Cape of Good Hope, as it led to the riches of the East Indies.[37] Dias' feat of navigation was later immortalised in Lu√≠s de Cam√µes' Portuguese epic poem, The Lusiads (1572).\nBy the early 17th century, Portugal's maritime power was starting to decline, and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade.[38] Representatives of the British East India Company did call sporadically at the Cape in search of provisions as early as 1601, but later came to favour Ascension Island and St. Helena as alternative ports of refuge.[39] Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) were shipwrecked at the Cape for several months. The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives.[39] They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil.[40] Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the Cape's potential as a \"warehouse and garden\" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages.[39]\nIn 1652, a century and a half after the discovery of the Cape sea route, Jan van Riebeeck established a victualling station at the Cape of Good Hope, at what would become Cape Town, on behalf of the Dutch East India Company.[41][42] In time, the Cape became home to a large population of vrijlieden, also known as vrijburgers (lit.‚Äâ'free citizens'), former company employees who stayed in Dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts.[42] Dutch traders also brought thousands of enslaved people to the fledgling colony from Indonesia, Madagascar, and parts of eastern Africa.[43] Some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were formed between vrijburgers, enslaved people, and indigenous peoples.[44] This led to the development of a new ethnic group, the Cape Coloureds, most of whom adopted the Dutch language and Christian faith.[44]\nThe eastward expansion of Dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating Xhosa tribe, known as the Xhosa Wars, as both sides competed for the pastureland near the Great Fish River, which the colonists required to graze their cattle.[45] Vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as Boers, with some adopting semi-nomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers.[45] The Boers formed loose militias, which they termed commandos, and forged alliances with Khoisan peoples to repel Xhosa raids.[45] Both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives, and sporadic violence, often accompanied by livestock theft, remained common for several decades.[45]\nGreat Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic, which had invaded the Low Countries.[45] After briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803, the Cape was occupied again by the British in 1806.[46] Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire.[47] British emigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers.[47] The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons, namely to increase the size of the European workforce and to bolster frontier regions against Xhosa incursions.[47]\nIn the first two decades of the 19th century, the Zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader, Shaka.[48] Shaka's warfare indirectly led to the Mfecane ('crushing'), in which 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 people were killed and the inland plateau was devastated and depopulated in the early 1820s.[49][50] An offshoot of the Zulu, the Matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king Mzilikazi.\nDuring the early 1800s, many Dutch settlers departed from the Cape Colony, where they had been subjected to British control, in a series of migrant groups who came to be known as Voortrekkers, meaning \"pathfinders\" or \"pioneers\". They migrated to the future Natal, Free State, and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the Boer Republics: the South African Republic (now Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West provinces), the Natalia Republic (KwaZulu-Natal), and the Orange Free State (Free State).\nThe discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the Mineral Revolution and increased economic growth and immigration. This intensified British efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples. The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British.[51]\nOn 16 May 1876, President Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers of the South African Republic (Transvaal) declared war against Sekhukhune and the Pedi. Sekhukhune managed to defeat the Transvaal army on 1 August 1876. Another attack by the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps was also repulsed. On 16 February 1877, the two parties signed a peace treaty at Botshabelo.[52] The Boers' inability to subdue Sekhukhune and the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of Paul Kruger and the British annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) on 12 April 1877 by Theophilus Shepstone, secretary for native affairs of Natal. In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until Garnet Wolseley defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers, Boers and 10,000 Swazis.\nThe Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the United Kingdom and the Zulu Kingdom. Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as the British High Commissioner to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers, and the Kingdom of Zululand's army. The Zulu nation defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana. Eventually, though, the war was lost, resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation's independence.\nThe Boer Republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War (1880‚Äì1881) using guerrilla warfare tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) but suffered heavy casualties through attrition; nonetheless, they were ultimately successful. Over 27,000 Boer women and children died in the British concentration camps.[53]\nWithin the country, anti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, racial segregation was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws.[54][55][56][57][58]\nEight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation, an act of the British Parliament (South Africa Act 1909) granted nominal independence, while creating the Union of South Africa on 31 May 1910. The Union was a dominion that included the former territories of the Cape, Transvaal and Natal colonies, as well as the Orange Free State republic.[59]\nThe Natives' Land Act of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks; at that stage they controlled only seven percent of the country. The amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased.[60]\nIn 1931, the union was fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, which abolished the last powers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate on the country. In 1934, the South African Party and National Party merged to form the United Party, seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. In 1939, the party split over the entry of the Union into World War II as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party followers strongly opposed.\nIn 1948, the National Party was elected to power. It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule. Taking Canada's Indian Act as a framework,[61] the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each. The white minority (less than 20%)[62] controlled the vastly larger black majority. The legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid. While whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, comparable to First World Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. The Freedom Charter, adopted in 1955 by the Congress Alliance, demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.\nOn 31 May 1961, the country became a republic following a referendum (only open to white voters) which narrowly passed;[63] the British-dominated Natal province largely voted against the proposal. Queen Elizabeth II lost the title Queen of South Africa, and the last Governor-General, Charles Robberts Swart, became State President. As a concession to the Westminster system, the appointment of the president remained an appointment by parliament, and virtually powerless until P. W. Botha's Constitution Act of 1983, which eliminated the office of Prime Minister and instated a near-unique \"strong presidency\" responsible to parliament. Pressured by other Commonwealth of Nations countries, South Africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961 and rejoined it only in 1994.\nDespite opposition both within and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid. The security forces cracked down on internal dissent, and violence became widespread, with anti-apartheid organisations such as the African National Congress (ANC), the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO), and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) carrying out guerrilla warfare[64] and urban sabotage.[65] The three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence.[66] Apartheid became increasingly controversial, and several countries began to boycott business with the South African government because of its racial policies. These measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors.[67][68]\nIn the late 1970s, South Africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development. In the following decade, it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons.[69][70]\nThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, FW de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.\nIn 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations. It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years' serving a sentence for sabotage. A negotiation process followed. With approval from the white electorate in a 1992 referendum, the government continued negotiations to end apartheid. South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. South Africa held its first universal elections in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since. The country rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations and became a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\nIn post-apartheid South Africa, unemployment remained high. While many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes, the overall unemployment rate of black people worsened between 1994 and 2003 by official metrics, but declined significantly using expanded definitions.[71] Poverty among whites, which was previously rare, increased.[72] In addition, the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. The United Nations (UN) Human Development Index (HDI) of South Africa fell from 1995 to 2005, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s,[73] before recovering its 1995 peak in 2013.[74] This is in large part attributable to the South African HIV/AIDS pandemic which saw South African life expectancy fall from a high point of 62.25 years in 1992 to a low of 52.57 in 2005,[75] and the failure of the government to take steps to address the pandemic in its early years.[76]\nIn May 2008, riots left over 60 people dead.[77] The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions estimated that over 100,000 people were driven from their homes.[78] The targets were mainly legal and illegal migrants, and refugees seeking asylum, but a third of the victims were South African citizens.[77] In a 2006 survey, the South African Migration Project concluded that South Africans are more opposed to immigration than any other national group.[79] The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 2008 reported over 200,000 refugees applied for asylum in South Africa, almost four times as many as the year before.[80] These people were mainly from Zimbabwe, though many also come from Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.[80] Competition over jobs, business opportunities, public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities.[80] While xenophobia in South Africa is still a problem, recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared.[80] Nevertheless, as South Africa continues to grapple with racial issues, one of the proposed solutions has been to pass legislation, such as the pending Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, to uphold South Africa's ban on racism and commitment to equality.[81][82]\nSouth Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long coastline that stretches more than 2,500¬†km (1,553¬†mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). At 1,219,912¬†km2 (471,011¬†sq¬†mi),[83] South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world.[84] It is about the same size as Colombia, twice the size of France, three times as big as Japan, four times the size of Italy and five times the size of the United Kingdom.[85]\nMafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450¬†m (11,320¬†ft) is the highest peak in South Africa. Excluding the Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22¬∞ and 35¬∞S, and longitudes 16¬∞ and 33¬∞E.\nThe interior of South Africa consists of a vast, in most places almost flat, plateau with an altitude of between 1,000¬†m (3,300¬†ft) and 2,100¬†m (6,900¬†ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly less noticeably so to the south and south-west.[86] This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment[87] whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the Drakensberg.[88]\nThe south and south-western parts of the plateau (at approximately 1,100‚Äì1,800¬†m above sea level), and the adjoining plain below (at approximately 700‚Äì800¬†m above sea level¬†‚Äì¬†see map on the right) is known as the Great Karoo, which consists of sparsely populated scrubland. To the north, the Great Karoo fades into the even drier and more arid Bushmanland, which eventually becomes the Kalahari desert in the very north-west of the country. The mid-eastern, and highest part of the plateau is known as the Highveld. This relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the country's commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation (Gauteng). To the north of Highveld, from about the 25¬∞¬†30'¬†S line of latitude, the plateau slopes downwards into the Bushveld, which ultimately gives way to the Limpopo lowlands or Lowveld.[87]\nThe coastal belt, below the Great Escarpment, moving clockwise from the northeast, consists of the Limpopo Lowveld, which merges into the Mpumalanga Lowveld, below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg (the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment).[89] This is hotter, drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment.[87] The Kruger National Park, located in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa, occupies a large portion of the Lowveld covering 19,633 square kilometres (7,580 sq mi.)[90] South of the Lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters KwaZulu-Natal Province, which, especially near the coast, is subtropically hot and humid. The KwaZulu-Natal‚ÄìLesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment, or Drakensberg, which reaches an altitude of over 3,000¬†m (9,800¬†ft).[91] The climate at the foot of this part of the Drakensberg is temperate.\nThe coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the Great Escarpment contains several ranges of Cape Fold Mountains which run parallel to the coast, separating the Great Escarpment from the ocean.[92][93] (These parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map, above left. Note the course of the Great Escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges.) The land (at approximately 400‚Äì500¬†m above sea level) between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south (i.e. between the Outeniqua and Langeberg ranges to the south and the Swartberg range to the north) is known as the Little Karoo,[87] which consists of semi-desert scrubland similar to that of the Great Karoo, except that its northern strip along the foothills of the Swartberg Mountains, has a somewhat higher rainfall and is, therefore, more cultivated than the Great Karoo. The Little Karoo is historically, and still, famous for its ostrich farming around the town of Oudtshoorn. The lowland area (700‚Äì800¬†m above sea level) to the north of the Swartberg mountain range up to the Great Escarpment is the lowland part of the Great Karoo (see map at top right), which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the Karoo above the Great Escarpment. The narrow coastal strip between the most seaward Cape Fold Mountain range (i.e., the Langeberg‚ÄìOuteniqua mountains) and the ocean has a moderately high year-round rainfall, especially in the George-Knysna-Plettenberg Bay region, which is known as the Garden Route. It is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in South Africa (a generally forest-poor country).\nIn the south-west corner of the country, the Cape Peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the Atlantic Ocean and ultimately terminates at the country's border with Namibia at the Orange River. The Cape Peninsula has a Mediterranean climate, making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of Africa south of the Sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter.[94][95] The greater Cape Town metropolitan area is situated on the Cape Peninsula and is home to 3.7¬†million people according to the 2011 population census. It is the country's legislative capital.\nThe coastal belt to the north of the Cape Peninsula is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and the first row of north‚Äìsouth running Cape Fold Mountains to the east. The Cape Fold Mountains peter out at about the 32¬∞¬†S line of latitude,[93] after which the coastal plain is bounded by the Great Escarpment itself. The most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the Swartland and Malmesbury Plain, which is an important wheat growing region, relying on winter rains. The region further north is known as Namaqualand,[96] which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the Orange River. The little rain that falls tends to fall in winter,[95] which results in one of the world's most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring (August‚ÄìSeptember).\nSouth Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the Prince Edward Islands, consisting of Marion Island (290¬†km2 or 110¬†sq¬†mi) and Prince Edward Island (45¬†km2 or 17¬†sq¬†mi) (not to be confused with the Canadian province of the same name).\nSouth Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere, and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland. This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones. The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean. Winters in South Africa occur between June and August.\nThe extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket. This area also produces much of the wine in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the Garden Route.\nThe Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740¬†m (5,709¬†ft) above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760¬†mm (29.9¬†in). Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare.\nThe high Drakensberg mountains, which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited skiing opportunities in winter. The coldest place on mainland South Africa is Buffelsfontein in the Eastern Cape, where a temperature of ‚àí20.1¬†¬∞C (‚àí4.2¬†¬∞F) was recorded in 2013.[97] The Prince Edward Islands have colder average annual temperatures, but Buffelsfontein has colder extremes. The deep interior of mainland South Africa has the hottest temperatures: a temperature of 51.7¬†¬∞C (125.06¬†¬∞F) was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near Upington,[98] but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment, the official highest temperature is 48.8¬†¬∞C (119.84¬†¬∞F) at Vioolsdrif in January 1993.[99]\nSouth Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994, and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995.[104] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006.[105] The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries.[106] Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity.\nNumerous mammals are found in the Bushveld including lions, African leopards, South African cheetahs, southern white rhinos, blue wildebeest, kudus, impalas, hyenas, hippopotamuses and South African giraffes. A significant extent of the Bushveld exists in the north-east including Kruger National Park and the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, as well as in the far north in the Waterberg Biosphere. South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticullaris) in the Karoo.\nUp to 1945, more than 4900 species of fungi (including lichen-forming species) had been recorded.[107] In 2006, the number of fungi in South Africa was estimated at about 200,000 species, but did not take into account fungi associated with insects.[108] If correct, then the number of South African fungi dwarfs that of its plants. In at least some major South African ecosystems, an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur.[109] The country's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan does not mention fungi (including lichen-forming fungi).[105]\nWith more than 22,000 different higher plants, or about 9% of all the known species of plants on Earth,[110] South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity. The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the grassland, particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses, low shrubs, and acacia trees, mainly camel-thorn (Vachellia erioloba). Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall. There are several species of water-storing succulents, like aloes and euphorbias, in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park.[111]\nThe fynbos biome, which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the Cape floristic region, one of the six floral kingdoms, is located in a small region of the Western Cape and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversity. Most of the plants are evergreen hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like leaves, such as the sclerophyllous plants. Another uniquely South African flowering plant group is the genus Protea. There are around 130 different species of Protea in South Africa.\nWhile South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, only one percent of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the humid coastal plain of KwaZulu-Natal, where there are also areas of Southern Africa mangroves in river mouths. There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of fire, known as montane forests. Plantations of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native eucalyptus and pine.\nSouth Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to overpopulation, sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the 19th century. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.94/10, ranking it 112th globally out of 172 countries.[112] South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g., black wattle, Port Jackson willow, Hakea, Lantana and Jacaranda) posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources. The original temperate forest found by the first European settlers was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African hardwood trees like real yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius), stinkwood (Ocotea bullata), and South African black ironwood (Olea laurifolia) are under government protection. Statistics from the South African Department of Environmental Affairs show a record 1,215 rhinos were killed in 2014.[113]\nClimate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, flooding and drought. According to computer-generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute,[114] parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about 1¬†¬∞C (1.8¬†¬∞F) along the coast to more than 4¬†¬∞C (7.2¬†¬∞F) in the already hot hinterland such as the Northern Cape in late spring and summertime by 2050. The Cape Floral Region, being identified as one of the global biodiversity hotspots, will be hit very hard by climate change. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire, and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction. South Africa has published two national climate change reports in 2011 and 2016.[115]\nSouth Africa is a parliamentary republic, although unlike most such republics the President is both head of state and head of government, and depends for his tenure on the confidence of Parliament. The executive, legislature and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution, and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional.\nThe National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation. The National Council of Provinces, the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members.\nAfter each parliamentary election, the National Assembly elects one of its members as president; hence the President serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly, normally five years. No President may serve more than two terms in office.[116] The President appoints a Deputy President and Ministers, who form the Cabinet which consists of Departments. The President and the Cabinet may be removed by the National Assembly by a motion of no confidence.\nIn the most recent election, held on 8 May 2019, the ANC won 57.5% of the vote and 230 seats, while the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA) won 20.77% of the vote and 84 seats. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), founded by Julius Malema, former President of the ANC's Youth Wing (ANC Youth League) who was later expelled from the ANC, won 10.79% of the vote and 44 seats. The ANC has been the governing political party in South Africa since the end of apartheid.\nSouth Africa has no legally defined capital city. The fourth chapter of the Constitution of South Africa, states that \"The seat of Parliament is Cape Town, but an Act of Parliament enacted in accordance with section 76(1) and (5) may determine that the seat of Parliament is elsewhere.\"[117] The country's three branches of government are split over different cities. Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital; Pretoria, as the seat of the President and Cabinet, is the administrative capital; and Bloemfontein, as the seat of the Supreme Court of Appeal, is the judicial capital, while the Constitutional Court of South Africa sits in Johannesburg. Most foreign embassies are located in Pretoria.\nSince 2004, South Africa has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the \"most protest-rich country in the world\".[118] There have been a number of incidents of political repression as well as threats of future repression in violation of the constitution, leading some analysts and civil society organisations to conclude that there is or could be a new climate of political repression,[119][120] or a decline in political tolerance.[121]\nIn 2008, South Africa placed fifth out of 48 sub-Saharan African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance. South Africa scored well in the categories of Rule of Law, Transparency and Corruption, and Participation and Human Rights, but was let down by its relatively poor performance in Safety and Security.[122] In November 2006, South Africa became the first African country to legalise same-sex marriage.[123]\nThe Constitution of South Africa is the supreme rule of law in the country. The primary sources of South African law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism.[124] The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the Dutch East India Company and is called Roman-Dutch law. It was imported before the codification of European law into the Napoleonic Code and is comparable in many ways to Scots law. This was followed in the 19th century by English law, both common and statutory. After unification in 1910, South Africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.\nThe judicial system consists of the magistrates' courts, which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases; the High Court, which has divisions that serve as the courts of general jurisdiction for specific areas; the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court.\nFrom April 2017 to March 2018, on average 57 murders were committed each day in South Africa.[125] In the year ended March 2017, there were 20,336 murders and the murder rate was 35.9 per 100,000 ‚Äì over five times higher than the global average of 6.2 per 100,000.[126] Middle-class South Africans seek security in gated communities.[127] The private security industry in South Africa is the largest in the world,[128] with nearly 9,000 registered companies and 400,000 registered active private security guards, more than the South African police and army combined.[129] Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a major factor in their decision to leave.[130] Crime against the farming community has continued to be a major problem.[131] In an attempt to reduce crime rate, the police arrested over 500 undocumented foreigners in a raid in August 2019.[132]\nSouth Africa has a high rape rate, with 43,195 rapes reported in 2014/15, and an unknown number of sexual assaults going unreported.[133] A 2009 survey of 1,738 men in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape by the Medical Research Council found one in four men admitted to raping someone[134] and another survey of 4,000 women in Johannesburg by CIET Africa found one in three said they had been raped in the past year.[135] Rape occurs most commonly in relationships, but many men and women say that rape cannot occur in relationships; however, one in four women reported having been abused by an intimate partner.[136] Rapes are also perpetrated by children (some as young as ten).[137] The incidence of child and infant rape is among the highest in the world, largely as a result of the virgin cleansing myth, and a number of high-profile cases (sometimes as young as eight months)[137] have outraged the nation.[138]\nBetween 1994 and 2018, there were more than 500 xenophobic attacks against foreigners in South Africa.[139] The 2019 Johannesburg riots were similar in nature and origin to the 2008 xenophobic riots that also occurred in Johannesburg.[140]\nAs the Union of South Africa, the country was a founding member of the UN. The then Prime Minister Jan Smuts wrote the preamble to the UN Charter.[141][142] South Africa is one of the founding members of the African Union (AU), and has the third largest economy of all the members. It is also a founding member of the AU's New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).\nSouth Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Comoros, and Zimbabwe. After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Southern African Customs Union (SACU), Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), World Trade Organization (WTO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), G20, G8+5, and the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa.\nFormer South African President Jacob Zuma and former Chinese President Hu Jintao upgraded bilateral ties between the two countries on 24 August 2010, when they signed the Beijing Agreement, which elevated South Africa's earlier \"strategic partnership\" with China to the higher level of \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" in both economic and political affairs, including the strengthening of exchanges between their respective ruling parties and legislatures.[143][144] In April 2011, South Africa formally joined the Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRICS) grouping of countries, identified by Zuma as the country's largest trading partners, and also the largest trading partners with Africa as a whole. Zuma asserted that BRICS member countries would also work with each other through the UN, the Group of Twenty (G20) and the India, Brazil South Africa (IBSA) forum.[145]\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was created in 1994,[146][147] as an all-volunteer military composed of the former South African Defence Force, the forces of the African nationalist groups (uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army), and the former Bantustan defence forces.[146] The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the South African Army, the South African Air Force, the South African Navy, and the South African Military Health Service.[148] In recent years, the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa,[149] and has been involved in operations in Lesotho, the DRC,[149] and Burundi,[149] amongst others. It has also served in multinational UN Peacekeeping forces such as the UN Force Intervention Brigade for example.\nSouth Africa is the only African country to have successfully developed nuclear weapons. It became the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.[150] South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s[150] According to former state president FW de Klerk, the decision to build a \"nuclear deterrent\" was taken \"as early as 1974 against a backdrop of a Soviet expansionist threat.\"[151] South Africa is alleged to have conducted a nuclear test over the Atlantic in 1979,[152] although this is officially denied. Former president de Klerk maintained that South Africa had \"never conducted a clandestine nuclear test.\"[151] Six nuclear devices were completed between 1980 and 1990, but all were dismantled before South Africa signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.[151] In 2017, South Africa signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[153]\nEach of the nine provinces is governed by a unicameral legislature, which is elected every five years by party-list proportional representation. The legislature elects a Premier as head of government, and the Premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet. The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the Constitution; these topics include such fields as health, education, public housing and transport.\nThe provinces are in turn divided into 52 districts: 8 metropolitan and 44 district municipalities. The district municipalities are further subdivided into 205 local municipalities. The metropolitan municipalities, which govern the largest urban agglomerations, perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.\nSouth Africa has a mixed economy, the second largest in Africa after Nigeria. It also has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (US$11,750 at purchasing power parity as of 2012). Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment, and is also ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality,[156][157][158] measured by the Gini coefficient. In 2015, 71 percent of net wealth are held by 10 percent richest of the population, whereas 60 percent of the poorest held only 7 percent of the net wealth and the Gini coefficient was 0.63, whereas in 1996 was 0.61.[159]\nUnlike most of the world's poor countries, South Africa does not have a thriving informal economy. Only 15% of South African jobs are in the informal sector, compared with around half in Brazil and India and nearly three-quarters in Indonesia. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) attributes this difference to South Africa's widespread welfare system.[160] World Bank research shows that South Africa has one of the widest gaps between per capita GDP versus its Human Development Index (HDI) ranking, with only Botswana showing a larger gap.[161]\nAfter 1994, government policy brought down inflation, stabilised public finances, and some foreign capital was attracted, however growth was still subpar.[162] From 2004 onward, economic growth picked up significantly; both employment and capital formation increased.[162] During the presidency of Jacob Zuma, the government increased the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Some of the biggest SOEs are Eskom, the electric power monopoly, South African Airways (SAA), and Transnet, the railroad and ports monopoly. Some of these SOEs have not been profitable, such as SAA, which has required bailouts totaling R30¬†billion ($2.08 billion) over the 20 years preceding 2015.[163]\nPrincipal international trading partners of South Africa‚Äîbesides other African countries‚Äîinclude Germany, the United States, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and Spain.[164]\nThe South African agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of GDP for the nation.[165] Due to the aridity of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land.[166]\nIn August 2013, South Africa was ranked as the top African Country of the Future by fDi magazine based on the country's economic potential, labour environment, cost-effectiveness, infrastructure, business friendliness, and foreign direct investment strategy.[167]\nThe 2020 Financial Secrecy Index (FDI) ranks South Africa as the 58th safest tax haven in the world.[168]\nSouth Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism.[169]\nDuring 1995‚Äì2003, the number of formal jobs decreased and informal jobs increased; overall unemployment worsened.[71]\nThe government's Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies have drawn criticism from Neva Makgetla, lead economist for research and information at the Development Bank of Southern Africa, for focusing \"almost exclusively on promoting individual ownership by black people [which] does little to address broader economic disparities, though the rich may become more diverse.\"[170] Official affirmative action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class.[171] Other problems include state ownership and interference, which impose high barriers to entry in many areas.[172] Restrictive labour regulations have contributed to the unemployment malaise.[71]\nAlong with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a brain drain in the past 20 years.[173] and is almost certainly detrimental for the wellbeing of those reliant on the healthcare infrastructure.[174] The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad.[175] However, the statistics which purport to show a brain drain are disputed and also do not account for repatriation and expiry of foreign work contracts. According to several surveys,[176][177] there has been a reverse in brain drain following the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 and expiration of foreign work contracts. In the first quarter of 2011, confidence levels for graduate professionals were recorded at a level of 84% in a Professional Provident Society (PPS) survey.[178] Illegal immigrants are involved in informal trading.[179] Many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since the year 1994.[180]\nThe Human Rights Watch reported on 26 August 2019 about foreign national truck drivers being subjected to deadly attacks carried out by South African truck drivers. The organization urged the South African government to take immediate actions ensuring the safety of the foreign national truck drivers putting up with violence, harassment, intimidation, stoning, bombing, and shooting, by local truck drivers in the country.[181]\nSeveral important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa. The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967, Max Theiler developed a vaccine against yellow fever, Allan McLeod Cormack pioneered X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. With the exception of that of Barnard, all of these advancements were recognised with Nobel Prizes. Sydney Brenner won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in molecular biology.\nMark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte, that was subsequently bought out by world-leader VeriSign. Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, information technology and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa.[citation needed] It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South Africa cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.\nSouth Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the Southern African Large Telescope, the largest optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the Karoo Array Telescope as a pathfinder for the ‚Ç¨1.5¬†billion Square Kilometre Array project.[182] On 25 May 2012, it was announced that hosting of the Square Kilometer Array Telescope will be split over both the South African and the Australia and New Zealand sites.[183]\nTwo distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities. These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance. Following the end of apartheid, the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.[184] Sanitation access increased from 71% to 79% during the same period.[184] However, water supply and sanitation in South Africa has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry.[185]\nThe eastern parts of South Africa suffer from periodic droughts linked to the El Ni√±o weather phenomenon.[186] In early 2018, Cape Town, which has different weather patterns to the rest of the country,[186] faced a water crisis as the city's water supply was predicted to run dry before the end of June. Water-saving measures were in effect that required each citizen to use less than 50 litres (13¬†US¬†gal) a day.[187]\nDifferent methods of transport in South Africa include roads, railways, airports, water, and pipelines for petroleum oil. The majority of people in South Africa use informal minibus taxis as their main mode of transport. BRT has been implemented in some South African cities in an attempt to provide more formalised and safer public transport services. These systems have been widely criticised due to their large capital and operating costs. A \"freeway\" is different from most countries as certain things are forbidden which include certain motorcycles, no hand signals, and motor tricycles. South Africa has many major ports including Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth that allow ships and other boats to pass through, some carrying passengers and some carrying petroleum tankers.\nSouth Africa is a nation of about 55 million (2016) people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. The last census was held in 2011, with a more recent intercensal national survey conducted in 2016.[188] South Africa is home to an estimated five¬†million illegal immigrants, including some three¬†million Zimbabweans.[189][190][191] A series of anti-immigrant riots occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008.[192][193]\nStatistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[194] The 2011 census figures for these groups were: Black African at 79.2%, White at 8.9%, Coloured at 8.9%, Indian or Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[9]:21 The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population; this had declined to 16% by 1980.[195]\nSouth Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[196] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the DRC (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[196] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[196]\nSouth Africa has 11 official languages:[197] Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Pedi,[198] Tswana, Southern Sotho, Tsonga, Swazi, Venda, and Southern Ndebele (in order of first language speakers). In this regard it is fourth only to Bolivia, India, and Zimbabwe in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2011 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%), Xhosa (16.0%), and Afrikaans (13.5%).[9] Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it is only the fourth most common home language, that of only 9.6% of South Africans in 2011; nevertheless, it has become the de facto lingua franca of the nation.[9] Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans can speak English.[199] It is the second most commonly spoken language outside of the household, after Zulu.[200]\nThe country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Fanagalo, Khoe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi, and South African Sign Language.[201] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent.\nMany of the unofficial languages of the San and Khoekhoe peoples contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from the Bantu people who make up most of the Black Africans in South Africa, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and the remainder of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.\nWhite South Africans may also speak European languages, including Italian, Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), Dutch, German, and Greek, while some Indian South Africans speak Indian languages, such as Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. French is spoken in South Africa by migrants from Francophone Africa.\nAccording to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various Protestant denominations (broadly defined to include syncretic African initiated churches) and a minority of Roman Catholics and other Christians. Christian category includes Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (Afrikaans: Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk; 6.7%), and Anglican (3.8%). Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hindus 1.2%,[205] traditional African religion 0.3% and Judaism 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 0.6% were \"other\" and 1.4% were \"unspecified.\"[164][205][206]\nAfrican initiated churches formed the largest of the Christian groups. It was believed that many of the persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to traditional African religion. There are an estimated 200,000 traditional healers in South Africa, and up to 60% of South Africans consult these healers,[207] generally called sangoma ('diviner') or inyanga ('herbalist'). These healers use a combination of ancestral spiritual beliefs and a belief in the spiritual and medicinal properties of local fauna and flora, commonly known as muti ('medicine'), to facilitate healing in clients. Many peoples have syncretic religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences.[208]\nSouth African Muslims comprise mainly of those who are described as Coloureds and those who are described as Indians. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as those from other parts of Africa.[209] South African Muslims describe their faith as the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[209][210]\nSouth Africa is also home to a substantial Jewish population, descended from European Jews who arrived as a minority among other European settlers. This population peaked in the 1970s at 120,000, though only around 67,000 remain today, the rest having emigrated, mostly to Israel. Even so, these numbers make the Jewish community in South Africa the twelfth largest in the world.[211]\nThe adult literacy rate in 2007 was 88.7%.[212] South Africa has a three-tier system of education starting with primary school, followed by high school, and tertiary education in the form of (academic) universities and universities of technology. Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Grade R, or grade 0, is a pre-primary foundation year.[213] Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling.[214] High school education spans a further five years. The National Senior Certificate (NSC) examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a South African university.[213]\nPublic universities in South Africa are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically-oriented university degrees; universities of technology (formerly called technikons), which offer vocationally-oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology and 6 comprehensive universities.\nUnder apartheid, schools for black people were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called Bantu Education which only taught skills sufficient to work as labourers.[215]\nIn 2004, South Africa started reforming its tertiary education system, merging and incorporating small universities into larger institutions, and renaming all tertiary education institutions \"university\". By 2015, 1.4¬†million students in higher education have benefited from a financial aid scheme which was promulgated in 1999.[216]\nAccording to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African.[217] The healthcare spending in the country is about 9% of GDP.[218]\nAbout 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system,[218] which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources.[219]\nAbout 20% of the population uses private healthcare.[220] Only 16% of the population is covered by medical aid schemes.[221] The rest pay for private care out-of-pocket or through in-hospital-only plans.[220] The three dominant hospital groups, Mediclinic, Life Healthcare and Netcare, together control 75% of the private hospital market.[220]\nAccording to the 2015 UNAIDS Report, South Africa has an estimated seven million people living with HIV¬†‚Äì more than any other country in the world.[222] In 2018, HIV prevalence‚Äîthe percentage of people living with HIV‚Äîamong adults (15‚Äì49 years) was 20.4% and in the same year 71000 people died from an AIDS-related illness.[223]\nA 2008 study revealed that HIV/AIDS infection in South Africa is distinctly divided along racial lines: 13.6% of blacks are HIV-positive, whereas only 0.3% of whites have the virus.[224] Most deaths are experienced by economically active individuals, resulting in many AIDS orphans who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support.[225] It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa.[225]\nThe link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by former president Thabo Mbeki and his health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrition, and hence poverty, and not HIV.[226] In 2007, in response to international pressure, the government made efforts to fight AIDS.[227]\nAfter the 2009 general elections, former president Jacob Zuma appointed Dr Aaron Motsoaledi as the new health minister and committed his government to increasing funding for and widening the scope of HIV treatment,[228] and by 2015, South Africa had made significant progress, with the widespread availability of antiretroviral drugs resulted in an increase in life expectancy from 52.1 years to 62.5 years.[229]\nThe South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and Westernised, aspects of traditional culture have declined. Members of the middle class, who are predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people,[230] have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and Australasia.\nSouth African art includes the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered in a South African cave, and dated from 75,000 years ago.[231]\nThe scattered tribes of Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by Bantu/Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. New forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner trekboers and the urban white artists, earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.\nSouth African literature emerged from a unique social and political history. One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was Solomon Thekiso Plaatje's Mhudi, written in 1930. During the 1950s, Drum magazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to urban black culture.\nNotable white South African authors include Alan Paton, who published the novel Cry, the Beloved Country in 1948. Nadine Gordimer became the first South African to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, in 1991. JM Coetzee won the Nobel Prize for Literature, in 2003. When awarding the prize, the Swedish Academy stated that Coetzee \"in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider.\"[232]\nThe plays of Athol Fugard have been regularly premiered in fringe theatres in South Africa, London (Royal Court Theatre) and New York. Olive Schreiner's The Story of an African Farm (1883) was a revelation in Victorian literature: it is heralded by many as introducing feminism into the novel form.\nBreyten Breytenbach was jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid. Andr√© Brink was the first Afrikaner writer to be banned by the government after he released the novel A Dry White Season.\nThe South African media sector is large, and South Africa is one of Africa's major media centres. While South Africa's many broadcasters and publications reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, the most commonly used language is English. However, all ten other official languages are represented to some extent or another.\nThere is great diversity in South African music. Black musicians have developed a unique style called Kwaito, that is said to have taken over radio, television, and magazines.[233] Of note is Brenda Fassie, who launched to fame with her song \"Weekend Special\", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include Ladysmith Black Mambazo, while the Soweto String Quartet performs classic music with an African flavour. South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably Hugh Masekela, Jonas Gwangwa, Abdullah Ibrahim, Miriam Makeba, Jonathan Butler, Chris McGregor, and Sathima Bea Benjamin. Afrikaans music covers multiple genres, such as the contemporary Steve Hofmeyr, the punk rock band Fokofpolisiekar, and the singer-songwriter Jeremy Loops. South African popular musicians that have found international success include Johnny Clegg, rap-rave duo Die Antwoord, and rock band Seether.\nAlthough few South African film productions are known outside South Africa itself, many foreign films have been produced about South Africa. Arguably, the most high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was District 9. Other notable exceptions are the film Tsotsi, which won the Academy Award for Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards in 2006, as well as U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha, which won the Golden Bear at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival. In 2015, the Oliver Hermanus film The Endless River became the first South African film selected for the Venice Film Festival.\nSouth African cuisine is diverse; foods from many cultures are enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety available.\nSouth African cuisine is heavily meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as the braai, a variation of the barbecue. South Africa has also developed into a major wine producer, with some of the best vineyards lying in valleys around Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, Paarl and Barrydale.[235]\nSouth Africa's most popular sports are association football, rugby union and cricket.[236] Other sports with significant support are swimming, athletics, golf, boxing, tennis, ringball, and netball. Although football (soccer) commands the greatest following among the youth, other sports like basketball, surfing and skateboarding are increasingly popular.\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in South Africa. Footballers who have played for major foreign clubs include Steven Pienaar, Lucas Radebe and Philemon Masinga, Benni McCarthy, Aaron Mokoena, and Delron Buckley. South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter awarded South Africa a grade 9 out of 10 for successfully hosting the event.[237]\nFamous boxing personalities include Baby Jake Jacob Matlala, Vuyani Bungu, Welcome Ncita, Dingaan Thobela, Gerrie Coetzee and Brian Mitchell. Durban surfer Jordy Smith won the 2010 Billabong J-Bay Open making him the highest ranked surfer in the world. South Africa produced Formula One motor racing's 1979 world champion Jody Scheckter. Famous current cricket players include Kagiso Rabada, AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander, and Faf du Plessis; most also participate in the Indian Premier League.\nSouth Africa has also produced numerous world class rugby players, including Francois Pienaar, Joost van der Westhuizen, Danie Craven, Frik du Preez, Naas Botha, and Bryan Habana. South Africa has won the Rugby World Cup three times, tying New Zealand for the most Rugby World Cup wins. South Africa first won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which it hosted. They went on to win the tournament again in 2007 and in 2019. It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting the 1996 African Cup of Nations, with the national team, Bafana Bafana, going on to win the tournament. It also hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 World Twenty20 Championship. South Africa's national cricket team, the Proteas, has also won the inaugural edition of the 1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy by defeating West Indies in the final. South Africa's national blind cricket team also went on to win the inaugural edition of the Blind Cricket World Cup in 1998.\nIn 2004, the swimming team of Roland Schoeman, Lyndon Ferns, Darian Townsend and Ryk Neethling won the gold medal at the Olympic Games in Athens, simultaneously breaking the world record in the 4√ó100 Freestyle Relay. Penny Heyns won Olympic Gold in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. In 2012, Oscar Pistorius became the first double amputee sprinter to compete at the Olympic Games in London. In golf, Gary Player is generally regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time, having won the Career Grand Slam, one of five golfers to have done so. Other South African golfers to have won major tournaments include Bobby Locke, Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, Tim Clark, Trevor Immelman, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel.\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region\nCoordinates: .mw-parser-output .geo-default,.mw-parser-output .geo-dms,.mw-parser-output .geo-dec{display:inline}.mw-parser-output .geo-nondefault,.mw-parser-output .geo-multi-punct{display:none}.mw-parser-output .longitude,.mw-parser-output .latitude{white-space:nowrap}30¬∞S 25¬∞EÔªø / Ôªø30¬∞S 25¬∞EÔªø / -30; 25\n",

              "caption": "*[ WIKIPEDIA : South Africa ]*\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. With over 59¬†million people, it is the world's 23rd-most populous nation and covers an area of 1,221,037 square kilometres (471,445 square miles). South Africa has three capital cities: executive Pretoria, judicial Bloemfontein and legislative Cape Town. The largest city is Johannesburg. About 80% of South Africans are of Black African ancestry,[9] divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different African languages.[13] The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (White South Africans), Asian (Indian South Africans), and Multiracial (Coloured South Africans) ancestry.\nIt is bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres (1,739¬†mi) of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans;[14][15][13] to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini (former Swaziland); and it surrounds the enclaved country of Lesotho.[16] It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World, and the most populous country located entirely south of the equator. South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot, with a diversity of unique biomes and plant and animal life.\nSouth Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures, languages, and religions. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitution's recognition of 11 official languages, the fourth-highest number in the world.[13] According to the 2011 census, the two most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%) and Xhosa (16.0%).[9] The two next ones are of European origin: Afrikaans (13.5%) developed from Dutch and serves as the first language of most Coloured and White South Africans; English (9.6%) reflects the legacy of British colonialism, and is commonly used in public and commercial life. The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a coup d'√©tat, and regular elections have been held for almost a century. However, the vast majority of black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994.\nDuring the 20th century, the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority, which played a large role in the country's recent history and politics. The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, institutionalising previous racial segregation. After a long and sometimes violent struggle by the African National Congress (ANC) and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s. Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's liberal democracy, which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces. South Africa is often referred to as the \"rainbow nation\" to describe the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid.[17]\nSouth Africa is a developing country and ranks at 114th on the Human Development Index, the seventh-highest in Africa. It has been classified by the World Bank as a newly industrialised country, with the second-largest economy in Africa, and the 33rd-largest in the world.[18][19] South Africa also has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa. The country is a middle power in international affairs; it maintains significant regional influence and is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and G20.[20][21] However, crime, poverty and inequality remain widespread, with about a quarter of the population unemployed and living on less than US$1.25 a day.[22][23] Moreover, climate change is an important issue for South Africa: it is a major contributor to climate change as the 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases as of 2018 (in large part due to its coal industry),[24] and is vulnerable to many of its impacts, because of its water-insecure environment and vulnerable communities.\nThe name \"South Africa\" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation, the country was named the Union of South Africa in English and Unie van Zuid-Afrika in Dutch, reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate British colonies. Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the \"Republic of South Africa\" and Republiek van Suid-Afrika in Afrikaans. Since 1994, the country has had an official name in each of its 11 official languages.\nMzansi, derived from the Xhosa noun uMzantsi meaning \"south\", is a colloquial name for South Africa,[25][26] while some Pan-Africanist political parties prefer the term \"Azania\".[27]\nSouth Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human-fossil sites in the world.[28][29][30] Archaeologists have recovered extensive fossil remains from a series of caves in Gauteng Province. The area, a UNESCO World Heritage site, has been branded \"the Cradle of Humankind\". The sites include Sterkfontein, one of the richest sites for hominin fossils in the world. Other sites include Swartkrans, Gondolin Cave, Kromdraai, Coopers Cave and Malapa. Raymond Dart identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the Taung Child (found near Taung) in 1924. Further hominin remains have come from the sites of Makapansgat in Limpopo Province, Cornelia and Florisbad in the Free State Province, Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal Province, Klasies River Mouth in Eastern Cape Province and Pinnacle Point, Elandsfontein and Die Kelders Cave in Western Cape Province.\nThese finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago, starting with Australopithecus africanus.[31] There followed species including Australopithecus sediba, Homo ergaster, Homo erectus, Homo rhodesiensis, Homo helmei, Homo naledi and modern humans (Homo sapiens). Modern humans have inhabited Southern Africa for at least 170,000 years.\nVarious researchers have located pebble tools within the Vaal River valley.[32][33]\nSettlements of Bantu-speaking peoples, who were iron-using agriculturists and herdsmen, were already present south of the Limpopo River (now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe) by the 4th or 5th century CE (see Bantu expansion). They displaced, conquered and absorbed the original Khoisan speakers, the Khoikhoi and San peoples. The Bantu slowly moved south. The earliest ironworks in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the Xhosa people, whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the Great Fish River, in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger Iron Age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples.\nIn Mpumalanga Province, several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named Adam's Calendar, and the ruins are thought to be created by the Bakone, a Northern Sotho people.[34][35]\nAt the time of European contact, the dominant ethnic group were Bantu-speaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of Africa about one thousand years before. The two major historic groups were the Xhosa and Zulu peoples.\nIn 1487, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa.[36] On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as Walvis Bay in present-day Namibia). This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator Diogo C√£o (Cape Cross, north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, Rio do Infante, probably the present-day Groot River, in May 1488, but on his return he saw the Cape, which he first named Cabo das Tormentas ('Cape of Storms'). His King, John II, renamed the point Cabo da Boa Esperan√ßa, or Cape of Good Hope, as it led to the riches of the East Indies.[37] Dias' feat of navigation was later immortalised in Lu√≠s de Cam√µes' Portuguese epic poem, The Lusiads (1572).\nBy the early 17th century, Portugal's maritime power was starting to decline, and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade.[38] Representatives of the British East India Company did call sporadically at the Cape in search of provisions as early as 1601, but later came to favour Ascension Island and St. Helena as alternative ports of refuge.[39] Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) were shipwrecked at the Cape for several months. The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives.[39] They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil.[40] Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the Cape's potential as a \"warehouse and garden\" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages.[39]\nIn 1652, a century and a half after the discovery of the Cape sea route, Jan van Riebeeck established a victualling station at the Cape of Good Hope, at what would become Cape Town, on behalf of the Dutch East India Company.[41][42] In time, the Cape became home to a large population of vrijlieden, also known as vrijburgers (lit.‚Äâ'free citizens'), former company employees who stayed in Dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts.[42] Dutch traders also brought thousands of enslaved people to the fledgling colony from Indonesia, Madagascar, and parts of eastern Africa.[43] Some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were formed between vrijburgers, enslaved people, and indigenous peoples.[44] This led to the development of a new ethnic group, the Cape Coloureds, most of whom adopted the Dutch language and Christian faith.[44]\nThe eastward expansion of Dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating Xhosa tribe, known as the Xhosa Wars, as both sides competed for the pastureland near the Great Fish River, which the colonists required to graze their cattle.[45] Vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as Boers, with some adopting semi-nomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers.[45] The Boers formed loose militias, which they termed commandos, and forged alliances with Khoisan peoples to repel Xhosa raids.[45] Both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives, and sporadic violence, often accompanied by livestock theft, remained common for several decades.[45]\nGreat Britain occupied Cape Town between 1795 and 1803 to prevent it from falling under the control of the French First Republic, which had invaded the Low Countries.[45] After briefly returning to Dutch rule under the Batavian Republic in 1803, the Cape was occupied again by the British in 1806.[46] Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, it was formally ceded to Great Britain and became an integral part of the British Empire.[47] British emigration to South Africa began around 1818, subsequently culminating in the arrival of the 1820 Settlers.[47] The new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons, namely to increase the size of the European workforce and to bolster frontier regions against Xhosa incursions.[47]\nIn the first two decades of the 19th century, the Zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader, Shaka.[48] Shaka's warfare indirectly led to the Mfecane ('crushing'), in which 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 people were killed and the inland plateau was devastated and depopulated in the early 1820s.[49][50] An offshoot of the Zulu, the Matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king Mzilikazi.\nDuring the early 1800s, many Dutch settlers departed from the Cape Colony, where they had been subjected to British control, in a series of migrant groups who came to be known as Voortrekkers, meaning \"pathfinders\" or \"pioneers\". They migrated to the future Natal, Free State, and Transvaal regions. The Boers founded the Boer Republics: the South African Republic (now Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West provinces), the Natalia Republic (KwaZulu-Natal), and the Orange Free State (Free State).\nThe discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the Mineral Revolution and increased economic growth and immigration. This intensified British efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples. The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British.[51]\nOn 16 May 1876, President Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers of the South African Republic (Transvaal) declared war against Sekhukhune and the Pedi. Sekhukhune managed to defeat the Transvaal army on 1 August 1876. Another attack by the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps was also repulsed. On 16 February 1877, the two parties signed a peace treaty at Botshabelo.[52] The Boers' inability to subdue Sekhukhune and the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of Paul Kruger and the British annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) on 12 April 1877 by Theophilus Shepstone, secretary for native affairs of Natal. In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until Garnet Wolseley defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers, Boers and 10,000 Swazis.\nThe Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between the United Kingdom and the Zulu Kingdom. Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as the British High Commissioner to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers, and the Kingdom of Zululand's army. The Zulu nation defeated the British at the Battle of Isandlwana. Eventually, though, the war was lost, resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation's independence.\nThe Boer Republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the First Boer War (1880‚Äì1881) using guerrilla warfare tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) but suffered heavy casualties through attrition; nonetheless, they were ultimately successful. Over 27,000 Boer women and children died in the British concentration camps.[53]\nWithin the country, anti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, racial segregation was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the Native Location Act of 1879 and the system of pass laws.[54][55][56][57][58]\nEight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation, an act of the British Parliament (South Africa Act 1909) granted nominal independence, while creating the Union of South Africa on 31 May 1910. The Union was a dominion that included the former territories of the Cape, Transvaal and Natal colonies, as well as the Orange Free State republic.[59]\nThe Natives' Land Act of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks; at that stage they controlled only seven percent of the country. The amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased.[60]\nIn 1931, the union was fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, which abolished the last powers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to legislate on the country. In 1934, the South African Party and National Party merged to form the United Party, seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. In 1939, the party split over the entry of the Union into World War II as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which the National Party followers strongly opposed.\nIn 1948, the National Party was elected to power. It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule. Taking Canada's Indian Act as a framework,[61] the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each. The white minority (less than 20%)[62] controlled the vastly larger black majority. The legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid. While whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of Africa, comparable to First World Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. The Freedom Charter, adopted in 1955 by the Congress Alliance, demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.\nOn 31 May 1961, the country became a republic following a referendum (only open to white voters) which narrowly passed;[63] the British-dominated Natal province largely voted against the proposal. Queen Elizabeth II lost the title Queen of South Africa, and the last Governor-General, Charles Robberts Swart, became State President. As a concession to the Westminster system, the appointment of the president remained an appointment by parliament, and virtually powerless until P. W. Botha's Constitution Act of 1983, which eliminated the office of Prime Minister and instated a near-unique \"strong presidency\" responsible to parliament. Pressured by other Commonwealth of Nations countries, South Africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961 and rejoined it only in 1994.\nDespite opposition both within and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid. The security forces cracked down on internal dissent, and violence became widespread, with anti-apartheid organisations such as the African National Congress (ANC), the Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO), and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) carrying out guerrilla warfare[64] and urban sabotage.[65] The three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence.[66] Apartheid became increasingly controversial, and several countries began to boycott business with the South African government because of its racial policies. These measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors.[67][68]\nIn the late 1970s, South Africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development. In the following decade, it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons.[69][70]\nThe Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith, signed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Harry Schwarz in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, FW de Klerk opened bilateral discussions with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.\nIn 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations. It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years' serving a sentence for sabotage. A negotiation process followed. With approval from the white electorate in a 1992 referendum, the government continued negotiations to end apartheid. South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. South Africa held its first universal elections in 1994, which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since. The country rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations and became a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\nIn post-apartheid South Africa, unemployment remained high. While many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes, the overall unemployment rate of black people worsened between 1994 and 2003 by official metrics, but declined significantly using expanded definitions.[71] Poverty among whites, which was previously rare, increased.[72] In addition, the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. The United Nations (UN) Human Development Index (HDI) of South Africa fell from 1995 to 2005, while it was steadily rising until the mid-1990s,[73] before recovering its 1995 peak in 2013.[74] This is in large part attributable to the South African HIV/AIDS pandemic which saw South African life expectancy fall from a high point of 62.25 years in 1992 to a low of 52.57 in 2005,[75] and the failure of the government to take steps to address the pandemic in its early years.[76]\nIn May 2008, riots left over 60 people dead.[77] The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions estimated that over 100,000 people were driven from their homes.[78] The targets were mainly legal and illegal migrants, and refugees seeking asylum, but a third of the victims were South African citizens.[77] In a 2006 survey, the South African Migration Project concluded that South Africans are more opposed to immigration than any other national group.[79] The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in 2008 reported over 200,000 refugees applied for asylum in South Africa, almost four times as many as the year before.[80] These people were mainly from Zimbabwe, though many also come from Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.[80] Competition over jobs, business opportunities, public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities.[80] While xenophobia in South Africa is still a problem, recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared.[80] Nevertheless, as South Africa continues to grapple with racial issues, one of the proposed solutions has been to pass legislation, such as the pending Hate Crimes and Hate Speech Bill, to uphold South Africa's ban on racism and commitment to equality.[81][82]\nSouth Africa is located at the southernmost region of Africa, with a long coastline that stretches more than 2,500¬†km (1,553¬†mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). At 1,219,912¬†km2 (471,011¬†sq¬†mi),[83] South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world.[84] It is about the same size as Colombia, twice the size of France, three times as big as Japan, four times the size of Italy and five times the size of the United Kingdom.[85]\nMafadi in the Drakensberg at 3,450¬†m (11,320¬†ft) is the highest peak in South Africa. Excluding the Prince Edward Islands, the country lies between latitudes 22¬∞ and 35¬∞S, and longitudes 16¬∞ and 33¬∞E.\nThe interior of South Africa consists of a vast, in most places almost flat, plateau with an altitude of between 1,000¬†m (3,300¬†ft) and 2,100¬†m (6,900¬†ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly less noticeably so to the south and south-west.[86] This plateau is surrounded by the Great Escarpment[87] whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the Drakensberg.[88]\nThe south and south-western parts of the plateau (at approximately 1,100‚Äì1,800¬†m above sea level), and the adjoining plain below (at approximately 700‚Äì800¬†m above sea level¬†‚Äì¬†see map on the right) is known as the Great Karoo, which consists of sparsely populated scrubland. To the north, the Great Karoo fades into the even drier and more arid Bushmanland, which eventually becomes the Kalahari desert in the very north-west of the country. The mid-eastern, and highest part of the plateau is known as the Highveld. This relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the country's commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation (Gauteng). To the north of Highveld, from about the 25¬∞¬†30'¬†S line of latitude, the plateau slopes downwards into the Bushveld, which ultimately gives way to the Limpopo lowlands or Lowveld.[87]\nThe coastal belt, below the Great Escarpment, moving clockwise from the northeast, consists of the Limpopo Lowveld, which merges into the Mpumalanga Lowveld, below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg (the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment).[89] This is hotter, drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment.[87] The Kruger National Park, located in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa, occupies a large portion of the Lowveld covering 19,633 square kilometres (7,580 sq mi.)[90] South of the Lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters KwaZulu-Natal Province, which, especially near the coast, is subtropically hot and humid. The KwaZulu-Natal‚ÄìLesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment, or Drakensberg, which reaches an altitude of over 3,000¬†m (9,800¬†ft).[91] The climate at the foot of this part of the Drakensberg is temperate.\nThe coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the Great Escarpment contains several ranges of Cape Fold Mountains which run parallel to the coast, separating the Great Escarpment from the ocean.[92][93] (These parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map, above left. Note the course of the Great Escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges.) The land (at approximately 400‚Äì500¬†m above sea level) between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south (i.e. between the Outeniqua and Langeberg ranges to the south and the Swartberg range to the north) is known as the Little Karoo,[87] which consists of semi-desert scrubland similar to that of the Great Karoo, except that its northern strip along the foothills of the Swartberg Mountains, has a somewhat higher rainfall and is, therefore, more cultivated than the Great Karoo. The Little Karoo is historically, and still, famous for its ostrich farming around the town of Oudtshoorn. The lowland area (700‚Äì800¬†m above sea level) to the north of the Swartberg mountain range up to the Great Escarpment is the lowland part of the Great Karoo (see map at top right), which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the Karoo above the Great Escarpment. The narrow coastal strip between the most seaward Cape Fold Mountain range (i.e., the Langeberg‚ÄìOuteniqua mountains) and the ocean has a moderately high year-round rainfall, especially in the George-Knysna-Plettenberg Bay region, which is known as the Garden Route. It is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in South Africa (a generally forest-poor country).\nIn the south-west corner of the country, the Cape Peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the Atlantic Ocean and ultimately terminates at the country's border with Namibia at the Orange River. The Cape Peninsula has a Mediterranean climate, making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of Africa south of the Sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter.[94][95] The greater Cape Town metropolitan area is situated on the Cape Peninsula and is home to 3.7¬†million people according to the 2011 population census. It is the country's legislative capital.\nThe coastal belt to the north of the Cape Peninsula is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and the first row of north‚Äìsouth running Cape Fold Mountains to the east. The Cape Fold Mountains peter out at about the 32¬∞¬†S line of latitude,[93] after which the coastal plain is bounded by the Great Escarpment itself. The most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the Swartland and Malmesbury Plain, which is an important wheat growing region, relying on winter rains. The region further north is known as Namaqualand,[96] which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the Orange River. The little rain that falls tends to fall in winter,[95] which results in one of the world's most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring (August‚ÄìSeptember).\nSouth Africa also has one possession, the small sub-Antarctic archipelago of the Prince Edward Islands, consisting of Marion Island (290¬†km2 or 110¬†sq¬†mi) and Prince Edward Island (45¬†km2 or 17¬†sq¬†mi) (not to be confused with the Canadian province of the same name).\nSouth Africa has a generally temperate climate because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder Southern Hemisphere, and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland. This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones. The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern Namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean. Winters in South Africa occur between June and August.\nThe extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket. This area also produces much of the wine in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the Garden Route.\nThe Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740¬†m (5,709¬†ft) above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760¬†mm (29.9¬†in). Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare.\nThe high Drakensberg mountains, which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited skiing opportunities in winter. The coldest place on mainland South Africa is Buffelsfontein in the Eastern Cape, where a temperature of ‚àí20.1¬†¬∞C (‚àí4.2¬†¬∞F) was recorded in 2013.[97] The Prince Edward Islands have colder average annual temperatures, but Buffelsfontein has colder extremes. The deep interior of mainland South Africa has the hottest temperatures: a temperature of 51.7¬†¬∞C (125.06¬†¬∞F) was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near Upington,[98] but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment, the official highest temperature is 48.8¬†¬∞C (119.84¬†¬∞F) at Vioolsdrif in January 1993.[99]\nSouth Africa signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 4 June 1994, and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995.[104] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006.[105] The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen megadiverse countries.[106] Ecotourism in South Africa has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity.\nNumerous mammals are found in the Bushveld including lions, African leopards, South African cheetahs, southern white rhinos, blue wildebeest, kudus, impalas, hyenas, hippopotamuses and South African giraffes. A significant extent of the Bushveld exists in the north-east including Kruger National Park and the Sabi Sand Game Reserve, as well as in the far north in the Waterberg Biosphere. South Africa houses many endemic species, among them the critically endangered riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticullaris) in the Karoo.\nUp to 1945, more than 4900 species of fungi (including lichen-forming species) had been recorded.[107] In 2006, the number of fungi in South Africa was estimated at about 200,000 species, but did not take into account fungi associated with insects.[108] If correct, then the number of South African fungi dwarfs that of its plants. In at least some major South African ecosystems, an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur.[109] The country's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan does not mention fungi (including lichen-forming fungi).[105]\nWith more than 22,000 different higher plants, or about 9% of all the known species of plants on Earth,[110] South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity. The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the grassland, particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses, low shrubs, and acacia trees, mainly camel-thorn (Vachellia erioloba). Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall. There are several species of water-storing succulents, like aloes and euphorbias, in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park.[111]\nThe fynbos biome, which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the Cape floristic region, one of the six floral kingdoms, is located in a small region of the Western Cape and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversity. Most of the plants are evergreen hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like leaves, such as the sclerophyllous plants. Another uniquely South African flowering plant group is the genus Protea. There are around 130 different species of Protea in South Africa.\nWhile South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, only one percent of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the humid coastal plain of KwaZulu-Natal, where there are also areas of Southern Africa mangroves in river mouths. There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of fire, known as montane forests. Plantations of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native eucalyptus and pine.\nSouth Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to overpopulation, sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the 19th century. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.94/10, ranking it 112th globally out of 172 countries.[112] South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g., black wattle, Port Jackson willow, Hakea, Lantana and Jacaranda) posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources. The original temperate forest found by the first European settlers was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African hardwood trees like real yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius), stinkwood (Ocotea bullata), and South African black ironwood (Olea laurifolia) are under government protection. Statistics from the South African Department of Environmental Affairs show a record 1,215 rhinos were killed in 2014.[113]\nClimate change is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already semi-arid region, with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, flooding and drought. According to computer-generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute,[114] parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about 1¬†¬∞C (1.8¬†¬∞F) along the coast to more than 4¬†¬∞C (7.2¬†¬∞F) in the already hot hinterland such as the Northern Cape in late spring and summertime by 2050. The Cape Floral Region, being identified as one of the global biodiversity hotspots, will be hit very hard by climate change. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire, and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction. South Africa has published two national climate change reports in 2011 and 2016.[115]\nSouth Africa is a parliamentary republic, although unlike most such republics the President is both head of state and head of government, and depends for his tenure on the confidence of Parliament. The executive, legislature and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the Constitution, and the superior courts have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional.\nThe National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of party-list proportional representation. The National Council of Provinces, the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine provincial legislatures electing ten members.\nAfter each parliamentary election, the National Assembly elects one of its members as president; hence the President serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly, normally five years. No President may serve more than two terms in office.[116] The President appoints a Deputy President and Ministers, who form the Cabinet which consists of Departments. The President and the Cabinet may be removed by the National Assembly by a motion of no confidence.\nIn the most recent election, held on 8 May 2019, the ANC won 57.5% of the vote and 230 seats, while the main opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA) won 20.77% of the vote and 84 seats. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), founded by Julius Malema, former President of the ANC's Youth Wing (ANC Youth League) who was later expelled from the ANC, won 10.79% of the vote and 44 seats. The ANC has been the governing political party in South Africa since the end of apartheid.\nSouth Africa has no legally defined capital city. The fourth chapter of the Constitution of South Africa, states that \"The seat of Parliament is Cape Town, but an Act of Parliament enacted in accordance with section 76(1) and (5) may determine that the seat of Parliament is elsewhere.\"[117] The country's three branches of government are split over different cities. Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital; Pretoria, as the seat of the President and Cabinet, is the administrative capital; and Bloemfontein, as the seat of the Supreme Court of Appeal, is the judicial capital, while the Constitutional Court of South Africa sits in Johannesburg. Most foreign embassies are located in Pretoria.\nSince 2004, South Africa has had many thousands of popular protests, some violent, making it, according to one academic, the \"most protest-rich country in the world\".[118] There have been a number of incidents of political repression as well as threats of future repression in violation of the constitution, leading some analysts and civil society organisations to conclude that there is or could be a new climate of political repression,[119][120] or a decline in political tolerance.[121]\nIn 2008, South Africa placed fifth out of 48 sub-Saharan African countries on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance. South Africa scored well in the categories of Rule of Law, Transparency and Corruption, and Participation and Human Rights, but was let down by its relatively poor performance in Safety and Security.[122] In November 2006, South Africa became the first African country to legalise same-sex marriage.[123]\nThe Constitution of South Africa is the supreme rule of law in the country. The primary sources of South African law are Roman-Dutch mercantile law and personal law with English Common law, as imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism.[124] The first European based law in South Africa was brought by the Dutch East India Company and is called Roman-Dutch law. It was imported before the codification of European law into the Napoleonic Code and is comparable in many ways to Scots law. This was followed in the 19th century by English law, both common and statutory. After unification in 1910, South Africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.\nThe judicial system consists of the magistrates' courts, which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases; the High Court, which has divisions that serve as the courts of general jurisdiction for specific areas; the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court.\nFrom April 2017 to March 2018, on average 57 murders were committed each day in South Africa.[125] In the year ended March 2017, there were 20,336 murders and the murder rate was 35.9 per 100,000 ‚Äì over five times higher than the global average of 6.2 per 100,000.[126] Middle-class South Africans seek security in gated communities.[127] The private security industry in South Africa is the largest in the world,[128] with nearly 9,000 registered companies and 400,000 registered active private security guards, more than the South African police and army combined.[129] Many emigrants from South Africa also state that crime was a major factor in their decision to leave.[130] Crime against the farming community has continued to be a major problem.[131] In an attempt to reduce crime rate, the police arrested over 500 undocumented foreigners in a raid in August 2019.[132]\nSouth Africa has a high rape rate, with 43,195 rapes reported in 2014/15, and an unknown number of sexual assaults going unreported.[133] A 2009 survey of 1,738 men in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape by the Medical Research Council found one in four men admitted to raping someone[134] and another survey of 4,000 women in Johannesburg by CIET Africa found one in three said they had been raped in the past year.[135] Rape occurs most commonly in relationships, but many men and women say that rape cannot occur in relationships; however, one in four women reported having been abused by an intimate partner.[136] Rapes are also perpetrated by children (some as young as ten).[137] The incidence of child and infant rape is among the highest in the world, largely as a result of the virgin cleansing myth, and a number of high-profile cases (sometimes as young as eight months)[137] have outraged the nation.[138]\nBetween 1994 and 2018, there were more than 500 xenophobic attacks against foreigners in South Africa.[139] The 2019 Johannesburg riots were similar in nature and origin to the 2008 xenophobic riots that also occurred in Johannesburg.[140]\nAs the Union of South Africa, the country was a founding member of the UN. The then Prime Minister Jan Smuts wrote the preamble to the UN Charter.[141][142] South Africa is one of the founding members of the African Union (AU), and has the third largest economy of all the members. It is also a founding member of the AU's New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).\nSouth Africa has played a key role as a mediator in African conflicts over the last decade, such as in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Comoros, and Zimbabwe. After apartheid ended, South Africa was readmitted to the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is a member of the Group of 77 and chaired the organisation in 2006. South Africa is also a member of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Southern African Customs Union (SACU), Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), World Trade Organization (WTO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), G20, G8+5, and the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa.\nFormer South African President Jacob Zuma and former Chinese President Hu Jintao upgraded bilateral ties between the two countries on 24 August 2010, when they signed the Beijing Agreement, which elevated South Africa's earlier \"strategic partnership\" with China to the higher level of \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" in both economic and political affairs, including the strengthening of exchanges between their respective ruling parties and legislatures.[143][144] In April 2011, South Africa formally joined the Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRICS) grouping of countries, identified by Zuma as the country's largest trading partners, and also the largest trading partners with Africa as a whole. Zuma asserted that BRICS member countries would also work with each other through the UN, the Group of Twenty (G20) and the India, Brazil South Africa (IBSA) forum.[145]\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was created in 1994,[146][147] as an all-volunteer military composed of the former South African Defence Force, the forces of the African nationalist groups (uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People's Liberation Army), and the former Bantustan defence forces.[146] The SANDF is subdivided into four branches, the South African Army, the South African Air Force, the South African Navy, and the South African Military Health Service.[148] In recent years, the SANDF has become a major peacekeeping force in Africa,[149] and has been involved in operations in Lesotho, the DRC,[149] and Burundi,[149] amongst others. It has also served in multinational UN Peacekeeping forces such as the UN Force Intervention Brigade for example.\nSouth Africa is the only African country to have successfully developed nuclear weapons. It became the first country (followed by Ukraine) with nuclear capability to voluntarily renounce and dismantle its programme and in the process signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.[150] South Africa undertook a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s[150] According to former state president FW de Klerk, the decision to build a \"nuclear deterrent\" was taken \"as early as 1974 against a backdrop of a Soviet expansionist threat.\"[151] South Africa is alleged to have conducted a nuclear test over the Atlantic in 1979,[152] although this is officially denied. Former president de Klerk maintained that South Africa had \"never conducted a clandestine nuclear test.\"[151] Six nuclear devices were completed between 1980 and 1990, but all were dismantled before South Africa signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.[151] In 2017, South Africa signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[153]\nEach of the nine provinces is governed by a unicameral legislature, which is elected every five years by party-list proportional representation. The legislature elects a Premier as head of government, and the Premier appoints an Executive Council as a provincial cabinet. The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the Constitution; these topics include such fields as health, education, public housing and transport.\nThe provinces are in turn divided into 52 districts: 8 metropolitan and 44 district municipalities. The district municipalities are further subdivided into 205 local municipalities. The metropolitan municipalities, which govern the largest urban agglomerations, perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.\nSouth Africa has a mixed economy, the second largest in Africa after Nigeria. It also has a relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (US$11,750 at purchasing power parity as of 2012). Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment, and is also ranked in the top ten countries in the world for income inequality,[156][157][158] measured by the Gini coefficient. In 2015, 71 percent of net wealth are held by 10 percent richest of the population, whereas 60 percent of the poorest held only 7 percent of the net wealth and the Gini coefficient was 0.63, whereas in 1996 was 0.61.[159]\nUnlike most of the world's poor countries, South Africa does not have a thriving informal economy. Only 15% of South African jobs are in the informal sector, compared with around half in Brazil and India and nearly three-quarters in Indonesia. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) attributes this difference to South Africa's widespread welfare system.[160] World Bank research shows that South Africa has one of the widest gaps between per capita GDP versus its Human Development Index (HDI) ranking, with only Botswana showing a larger gap.[161]\nAfter 1994, government policy brought down inflation, stabilised public finances, and some foreign capital was attracted, however growth was still subpar.[162] From 2004 onward, economic growth picked up significantly; both employment and capital formation increased.[162] During the presidency of Jacob Zuma, the government increased the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Some of the biggest SOEs are Eskom, the electric power monopoly, South African Airways (SAA), and Transnet, the railroad and ports monopoly. Some of these SOEs have not been profitable, such as SAA, which has required bailouts totaling R30¬†billion ($2.08 billion) over the 20 years preceding 2015.[163]\nPrincipal international trading partners of South Africa‚Äîbesides other African countries‚Äîinclude Germany, the United States, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and Spain.[164]\nThe South African agricultural industry contributes around 10% of formal employment, relatively low compared to other parts of Africa, as well as providing work for casual labourers and contributing around 2.6% of GDP for the nation.[165] Due to the aridity of the land, only 13.5% can be used for crop production, and only 3% is considered high potential land.[166]\nIn August 2013, South Africa was ranked as the top African Country of the Future by fDi magazine based on the country's economic potential, labour environment, cost-effectiveness, infrastructure, business friendliness, and foreign direct investment strategy.[167]\nThe 2020 Financial Secrecy Index (FDI) ranks South Africa as the 58th safest tax haven in the world.[168]\nSouth Africa is a popular tourist destination, and a substantial amount of revenue comes from tourism.[169]\nDuring 1995‚Äì2003, the number of formal jobs decreased and informal jobs increased; overall unemployment worsened.[71]\nThe government's Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies have drawn criticism from Neva Makgetla, lead economist for research and information at the Development Bank of Southern Africa, for focusing \"almost exclusively on promoting individual ownership by black people [which] does little to address broader economic disparities, though the rich may become more diverse.\"[170] Official affirmative action policies have seen a rise in black economic wealth and an emerging black middle class.[171] Other problems include state ownership and interference, which impose high barriers to entry in many areas.[172] Restrictive labour regulations have contributed to the unemployment malaise.[71]\nAlong with many African nations, South Africa has been experiencing a brain drain in the past 20 years.[173] and is almost certainly detrimental for the wellbeing of those reliant on the healthcare infrastructure.[174] The skills drain in South Africa tends to demonstrate racial contours given the skills distribution legacy of South Africa and has thus resulted in large white South African communities abroad.[175] However, the statistics which purport to show a brain drain are disputed and also do not account for repatriation and expiry of foreign work contracts. According to several surveys,[176][177] there has been a reverse in brain drain following the global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 and expiration of foreign work contracts. In the first quarter of 2011, confidence levels for graduate professionals were recorded at a level of 84% in a Professional Provident Society (PPS) survey.[178] Illegal immigrants are involved in informal trading.[179] Many immigrants to South Africa continue to live in poor conditions, and the immigration policy has become increasingly restrictive since the year 1994.[180]\nThe Human Rights Watch reported on 26 August 2019 about foreign national truck drivers being subjected to deadly attacks carried out by South African truck drivers. The organization urged the South African government to take immediate actions ensuring the safety of the foreign national truck drivers putting up with violence, harassment, intimidation, stoning, bombing, and shooting, by local truck drivers in the country.[181]\nSeveral important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa. The first human-to-human heart transplant was performed by cardiac surgeon Christiaan Barnard at Groote Schuur Hospital in December 1967, Max Theiler developed a vaccine against yellow fever, Allan McLeod Cormack pioneered X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), and Aaron Klug developed crystallographic electron microscopy techniques. With the exception of that of Barnard, all of these advancements were recognised with Nobel Prizes. Sydney Brenner won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in molecular biology.\nMark Shuttleworth founded an early Internet security company Thawte, that was subsequently bought out by world-leader VeriSign. Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in biotechnology, information technology and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa.[citation needed] It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South Africa cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.\nSouth Africa has cultivated a burgeoning astronomy community. It hosts the Southern African Large Telescope, the largest optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the Karoo Array Telescope as a pathfinder for the ‚Ç¨1.5¬†billion Square Kilometre Array project.[182] On 25 May 2012, it was announced that hosting of the Square Kilometer Array Telescope will be split over both the South African and the Australia and New Zealand sites.[183]\nTwo distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities. These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance. Following the end of apartheid, the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.[184] Sanitation access increased from 71% to 79% during the same period.[184] However, water supply and sanitation in South Africa has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry.[185]\nThe eastern parts of South Africa suffer from periodic droughts linked to the El Ni√±o weather phenomenon.[186] In early 2018, Cape Town, which has different weather patterns to the rest of the country,[186] faced a water crisis as the city's water supply was predicted to run dry before the end of June. Water-saving measures were in effect that required each citizen to use less than 50 litres (13¬†US¬†gal) a day.[187]\nDifferent methods of transport in South Africa include roads, railways, airports, water, and pipelines for petroleum oil. The majority of people in South Africa use informal minibus taxis as their main mode of transport. BRT has been implemented in some South African cities in an attempt to provide more formalised and safer public transport services. These systems have been widely criticised due to their large capital and operating costs. A \"freeway\" is different from most countries as certain things are forbidden which include certain motorcycles, no hand signals, and motor tricycles. South Africa has many major ports including Cape Town, Durban, and Port Elizabeth that allow ships and other boats to pass through, some carrying passengers and some carrying petroleum tankers.\nSouth Africa is a nation of about 55 million (2016) people of diverse origins, cultures, languages, and religions. The last census was held in 2011, with a more recent intercensal national survey conducted in 2016.[188] South Africa is home to an estimated five¬†million illegal immigrants, including some three¬†million Zimbabweans.[189][190][191] A series of anti-immigrant riots occurred in South Africa beginning on 11 May 2008.[192][193]\nStatistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups.[194] The 2011 census figures for these groups were: Black African at 79.2%, White at 8.9%, Coloured at 8.9%, Indian or Asian at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.[9]:21 The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population; this had declined to 16% by 1980.[195]\nSouth Africa hosts a sizeable refugee and asylum seeker population. According to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, this population numbered approximately 144,700 in 2007.[196] Groups of refugees and asylum seekers numbering over 10,000 included people from Zimbabwe (48,400), the DRC (24,800), and Somalia (12,900).[196] These populations mainly lived in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, and Port Elizabeth.[196]\nSouth Africa has 11 official languages:[197] Zulu, Xhosa, Afrikaans, English, Pedi,[198] Tswana, Southern Sotho, Tsonga, Swazi, Venda, and Southern Ndebele (in order of first language speakers). In this regard it is fourth only to Bolivia, India, and Zimbabwe in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2011 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (22.7%), Xhosa (16.0%), and Afrikaans (13.5%).[9] Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it is only the fourth most common home language, that of only 9.6% of South Africans in 2011; nevertheless, it has become the de facto lingua franca of the nation.[9] Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans can speak English.[199] It is the second most commonly spoken language outside of the household, after Zulu.[200]\nThe country also recognises several unofficial languages, including Fanagalo, Khoe, Lobedu, Nama, Northern Ndebele, Phuthi, and South African Sign Language.[201] These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent.\nMany of the unofficial languages of the San and Khoekhoe peoples contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from the Bantu people who make up most of the Black Africans in South Africa, have their own cultural identity based on their hunter-gatherer societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and the remainder of their languages are in danger of becoming extinct.\nWhite South Africans may also speak European languages, including Italian, Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), Dutch, German, and Greek, while some Indian South Africans speak Indian languages, such as Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. French is spoken in South Africa by migrants from Francophone Africa.\nAccording to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various Protestant denominations (broadly defined to include syncretic African initiated churches) and a minority of Roman Catholics and other Christians. Christian category includes Zion Christian (11.1%), Pentecostal (Charismatic) (8.2%), Roman Catholic (7.1%), Methodist (6.8%), Dutch Reformed (Afrikaans: Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk; 6.7%), and Anglican (3.8%). Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. Muslims accounted for 1.5% of the population, Hindus 1.2%,[205] traditional African religion 0.3% and Judaism 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 0.6% were \"other\" and 1.4% were \"unspecified.\"[164][205][206]\nAfrican initiated churches formed the largest of the Christian groups. It was believed that many of the persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to traditional African religion. There are an estimated 200,000 traditional healers in South Africa, and up to 60% of South Africans consult these healers,[207] generally called sangoma ('diviner') or inyanga ('herbalist'). These healers use a combination of ancestral spiritual beliefs and a belief in the spiritual and medicinal properties of local fauna and flora, commonly known as muti ('medicine'), to facilitate healing in clients. Many peoples have syncretic religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences.[208]\nSouth African Muslims comprise mainly of those who are described as Coloureds and those who are described as Indians. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as those from other parts of Africa.[209] South African Muslims describe their faith as the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.[209][210]\nSouth Africa is also home to a substantial Jewish population, descended from European Jews who arrived as a minority among other European settlers. This population peaked in the 1970s at 120,000, though only around 67,000 remain today, the rest having emigrated, mostly to Israel. Even so, these numbers make the Jewish community in South Africa the twelfth largest in the world.[211]\nThe adult literacy rate in 2007 was 88.7%.[212] South Africa has a three-tier system of education starting with primary school, followed by high school, and tertiary education in the form of (academic) universities and universities of technology. Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Grade R, or grade 0, is a pre-primary foundation year.[213] Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling.[214] High school education spans a further five years. The National Senior Certificate (NSC) examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a South African university.[213]\nPublic universities in South Africa are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically-oriented university degrees; universities of technology (formerly called technikons), which offer vocationally-oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology and 6 comprehensive universities.\nUnder apartheid, schools for black people were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called Bantu Education which only taught skills sufficient to work as labourers.[215]\nIn 2004, South Africa started reforming its tertiary education system, merging and incorporating small universities into larger institutions, and renaming all tertiary education institutions \"university\". By 2015, 1.4¬†million students in higher education have benefited from a financial aid scheme which was promulgated in 1999.[216]\nAccording to the South African Institute of Race Relations, the life expectancy in 2009 was 71 years for a white South African and 48 years for a black South African.[217] The healthcare spending in the country is about 9% of GDP.[218]\nAbout 84% of the population depends on the public healthcare system,[218] which is beset with chronic human resource shortages and limited resources.[219]\nAbout 20% of the population uses private healthcare.[220] Only 16% of the population is covered by medical aid schemes.[221] The rest pay for private care out-of-pocket or through in-hospital-only plans.[220] The three dominant hospital groups, Mediclinic, Life Healthcare and Netcare, together control 75% of the private hospital market.[220]\nAccording to the 2015 UNAIDS Report, South Africa has an estimated seven million people living with HIV¬†‚Äì more than any other country in the world.[222] In 2018, HIV prevalence‚Äîthe percentage of people living with HIV‚Äîamong adults (15‚Äì49 years) was 20.4% and in the same year 71000 people died from an AIDS-related illness.[223]\nA 2008 study revealed that HIV/AIDS infection in South Africa is distinctly divided along racial lines: 13.6% of blacks are HIV-positive, whereas only 0.3% of whites have the virus.[224] Most deaths are experienced by economically active individuals, resulting in many AIDS orphans who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support.[225] It is estimated that there are 1,200,000 orphans in South Africa.[225]\nThe link between HIV, a virus spread primarily by sexual contact, and AIDS was long denied by former president Thabo Mbeki and his health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who insisted that the many deaths in the country are due to malnutrit",
